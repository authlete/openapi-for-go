        Possible values for `requestableScopes` parameter in the response from this API are as follows.

        **null**

        The user has not granted authorization to the client application in the past, or records about the
        combination of the user and the client application have been deleted from Authlete's DB.

        **An empty set**

        The user has granted authorization to the client application in the past, but no scopes are associated
        with the authorization.

        **A set with at least one element**

        The user has granted authorization to the client application in the past and some scopes are associated
        with the authorization. These scopes are returned.
        Example: `[ "profile", "email" ]`

  /api/{serviceApiKey}/auth/authorization:
    post:
      description: |
        This API parses request parameters of an authorization request and returns necessary data for the authorization server
        implementation to process the authorization request further.

        <br>
        <details>
        <summary>Description</summary>

        This API is supposed to be called from within the implementation of the authorization endpoint of
        the service. The endpoint implementation must extract the request parameters from the authorization
        request from the client application and pass them as the value of parameters request parameter for
        Authlete's `/auth/authorization` API.

        The value of `parameters` is either (1) the entire query string when the HTTP method of the request
        from the client application is `GET` or (2) the entire entity body (which is formatted in
        `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`) when the HTTP method of the request from the client application
        is `POST`.

        The following code snippet is an example in JAX-RS showing how to extract request parameters from
        the authorization request.

        ```java
        @GET
        public Response get(@Context UriInfo uriInfo)
        {
            // The query parameters of the authorization request.
            String parameters = uriInfo.getRequestUri().getQuery();
            ......
        }

        @POST
        @Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_FORM_URLENCODED)
        public Response post(String parameters)
        {
            // 'parameters' is the entity body of the authorization request.
            ......
        }
        ```

        The endpoint implementation does not have to parse the request parameters from the client application
        because Authlete's `/auth/authorization` API does it.

        The response from `/auth/authorization` API has various parameters. Among them, it is `action`
        parameter that the authorization server implementation should check first because it denotes the
        next action that the authorization server implementation should take. According to the value of
        `action`, the service implementation must take the steps described below.

        **INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR**

        When the value of `action` is `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`, it means that the request from the authorization
        server implementation was wrong or that an error occurred in Authlete.
        In either case, from the viewpoint of the client application, it is an error on the server side.
        Therefore, the service implementation should generate a response to the client application with
        HTTP status of "500 Internal Server Error". Authlete recommends `application/json` as the content
        type although OAuth 2.0 specification does not mention the format of the error response when the
        redirect URI is not usable.

        The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used as
        the entity body of the response.

        The following illustrates the response which the service implementation should generate and return
        to the client application.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
        Content-Type: application/json
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache

        {responseContent}
        ```

        The endpoint implementation may return another different response to the client application
        since "500 Internal Server Error" is not required by OAuth 2.0.

        **BAD_REQUEST**

        When the value of `action` is `BAD_REQUEST`, it means that the request from the client application
        is invalid.

        A response with HTTP status of "400 Bad Request" should be returned to the client application and
        Authlete recommends `application/json` as the content type although OAuth 2.0 specification does
        not mention the format of the error response when the redirect URI is not usable.

        The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used as
        the entity body of the response.

        The following illustrates the response which the service implementation should generate and return
        to the client application.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
        Content-Type: application/json
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache

        {responseContent}
        ```

        The endpoint implementation may return another different response to the client application since
        "400 Bad Request" is not required by OAuth 2.0.

        **LOCATION**

        When the value of `action` is `LOCATION`, it means that the request from the client application
        is invalid but the redirect URI
        to which the error should be reported has been determined.

        A response with HTTP status of "302 Found" must be returned to the client application with `Location`
        header which has a redirect URI with error parameter.

        The value of `responseContent` is a redirect URI with `error` parameter, so it can be used as the
        value of `Location` header.

        The following illustrates the response which the service implementation must generate and return
        to the client application.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 302 Found
        Location: {responseContent}
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache
        ```

        **FORM**

        When the value of `action` is `FORM`, it means that the request from the client application is
        invalid but the redirect URI to which the error should be reported has been determined, and that
        the authorization request contains `response_mode=form_post` as is defined in [OAuth 2.0 Form Post
        Response Mode](https://openid.net/specs/oauth-v2-form-post-response-mode-1_0.html).

        The HTTP status of the response returned to the client application should be "200 OK" and the
        content type should be `text/html;charset=UTF-8`.

        The value of `responseContent` is an HTML which can be used as the entity body of the response.

        The following illustrates the response which the service implementation must generate and return
        to the client application.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Content-Type: text/html;charset=UTF-8
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache

        {responseContent}
        ```

        **NO_INTERACTION**

        When the value of `action` is `NO_INTERACTION`, it means that the request from the client application
        has no problem and requires the service to process the request without displaying any user interface
        pages for authentication or consent. This case happens when the authorization request contains
        `prompt=none`.

        The service must follow the steps described below.

        [1] END-USER AUTHENTICATION

        Check whether an end-user has already logged in. If an end-user has logged in, go to the next step ([MAX_AGE]).
        Otherwise, call Authlete's `/auth/authorization/fail` API with `reason=NOT_LOGGED_IN` and use the response from
        the API to generate a response to the client application.

        [2] MAX AGE

        Get the value of `maxAge` parameter from the `/auth/authorization` API response. The value represents
        the maximum authentication age which has come from `max_age` request parameter or `defaultMaxAge`
        configuration parameter of the client application. If the value is `0`, go to the next step ([SUBJECT]).
        Otherwise, follow the sub steps described below.

        (i) Get the time at which the end-user was authenticated. that this value is not managed by Authlete,
        meaning that it is expected that the service implementation manages the value. If the service implementation
        does not manage authentication time of end-users, call Authlete's `/auth/authorization/fail` API
        with `reason=MAX_AGE_NOT_SUPPORTED` and use the API response to generate a response to the client
        application.

        (ii) Add the value of the maximum authentication age (which is represented in seconds) to the authentication
        time. The calculated value is the expiration time.

        (iii) Check whether the calculated value is equal to or greater than the current time. If this condition
        is satisfied, go to the next step ([SUBJECT]). Otherwise, call Authlete's `/auth/authorization/fail`
        API with `reason=EXCEEDS_MAX_AGE` and use the API response to generate a response to the client
        application.

        [3] SUBJECT

        Get the value of `subject` from the `/auth/authorization` API response. The value represents an
        end-user who the client application expects to grant authorization. If the value is `null`, go to
        the next step ([ACRs]). Otherwise, follow the sub steps described below.

        (i) Compare the value of the requested subject to the current end-user.

        (ii) If they are equal, go to the next step ([ACRs]). If they are not equal, call Authlete's
        `/auth/authorization/fail` API with `reason=DIFFERENT_SUBJECT` and use the response from the API
        to generate a response to the client application.

        [4] ACRs

        Get the value of `acrs` from the `/auth/authorization` API response. The value represents a list
        of ACRs (Authentication Context Class References) and comes from (1) acr claim in `claims` request
        parameter, (2) `acr_values` request parameter, or (3) `default_acr_values` configuration parameter
        of the client application.

        It is ensured that all the ACRs in acrs are supported by the authorization server implementation.
        In other words, it is ensured that all the ACRs are listed in `acr_values_supported` configuration
        parameter of the authorization server.

        If the value of ACRs is `null`, go to the next step ([ISSUE]). Otherwise, follow the sub steps
        described below.

        (i) Get the ACR performed for the authentication of the current end-user. Note that this value is
        managed not by Authlete but by the authorization server implementation. (If the authorization server
        implementation cannot handle ACRs, it should not have listed ACRs as `acr_values_supported`.)

        (ii) Compare the ACR value obtained in the above step to each element in the ACR array (`acrs`)
        in the listed order.

        (iii) If the ACR value was found in the array, (= the ACR performed for the authentication of the
        current end-user did not match any one of the ACRs requested by the client application), check
        whether one of the requested ACRs must be satisfied or not using `acrEssential` parameter in the
        `/auth/authorization` API response. If the value of `acrEssential` parameter is `true`, call Authlete's
        `/auth/authorization/fail` API with `reason=ACR_NOT_SATISFIED` and use the response from the API
        to generate a response to the client application. Otherwise, go to the next step ([SCOPES]).

        [5] SCOPES

        Get the value of `scopes` from the `/auth/authorization` API response. If the array contains a
        scope which has not been granted to the client application by the end-user in the past, call
        Authlete's `/auth/authorization/fail` API with `reason=CONSENT_REQUIRED` and use the response from
        the API to generate a response to the client application. Otherwise, go to the next step ([RESOURCES]).

        Note that Authlete provides APIs to manage records of granted scopes (`/api/client/granted_scopes/*`
        APIs), which is only available in a dedicated/onpremise Authlete server (contact sales@authlete.com
        for details).

        [6] DYNAMIC SCOPES

        Get the value of `dynamicScopes` from the `/auth/authorization` API response. If the array contains
        a scope which has not been granted to the client application by the end-user in the past, call
        Authlete's `/auth/authorization/fail` API with `reason=CONSENT_REQUIRED` and use the response from
        the API to generate a response to the client application. Otherwise, go to the next step ([RESOURCES]).

        Note that Authlete provides APIs to manage records of granted scopes (`/api/client/granted_scopes/*`
        APIs) but dynamic scopes are not remembered as granted scopes.

        [7] RESOURCES

        Get the value of `resources` from the `/auth/authorization` API response. The array represents
        the values of the `resource` request parameters. If you want to reject the request, call Authlete's
        `/auth/authorization/fail` API with `reason=INVALID_TARGET` and use the response from the API to
        generate a response to the client application. Otherwise, go to the next step ([ISSUE]).

        See "Resource Indicators for OAuth 2.0" for details.

        [8] ISSUE

        If all the above steps succeeded, the last step is to issue an authorization code, an ID token
        and/or an access token. (There is a special case, though. In the case of `response_type=none`,
        nothing is issued.) It can be performed by calling Authlete's `/auth/authorization/issue` API.
        The API requires the following parameters. Prepare these parameters and call `/auth/authorization/issue`
        API and use the response to generate a response to the client application.

        - <u>`ticket` (required)</u><br>
          This parameter represents a ticket which is exchanged with tokens at `/auth/authorization/issue`.
          Use the value of `ticket` contained in the `/auth/authorization` API response.

        - <u>`subject` (required)</u><br>
          This parameter represents the unique identifier of the current end-user. It is often called "user ID"
          and it may or may not be visible to the user. In any case, it is a number or a string assigned
          to an end-user by the authorization server implementation. Authlete does not care about the format
          of the value of subject, but it must consist of only ASCII letters and its length must not exceed 100.

          When the value of `subject` parameter in the /auth/authorization API response is not `null`,
          it is necessarily identical to the value of `subject` parameter in the `/auth/authorization/issue`
          API request.

          The value of this parameter will be embedded in an ID token as the value of `sub` claim. When
          the value of `subject_type` configuration parameter of the client application is `PAIRWISE`,
          the value of sub claim is different from the value specified by this parameter, See [8. Subject
          Identifier Types](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SubjectIDTypes) of OpenID
          Connect Core 1.0 for details about subject types.

          You can use the `sub` request parameter to adjust the value of the `sub` claim in an ID token.
          See the description of the `sub` request parameter for details.

        - <u>`authTime` (optional)</u><br>
          This parameter represents the time when the end-user authentication occurred. Its value is the
          number of seconds from `1970-01-01`. The value of this parameter will be embedded in an ID token
          as the value of `auth_time` claim.

        - <u>`acr` (optional)</u><br>
          This parameter represents the ACR (Authentication Context Class Reference) which the authentication
          of the end-user satisfies. When `acrs` in the `/auth/authorization` API response is a non-empty
          array and the value of `acrEssential` is `true`, the value of this parameter must be one of the
          array elements. Otherwise, even `null` is allowed. The value of this parameter will be embedded
          in an ID token as the value of `acr` claim.

        - <u>`claims` (optional)</u><br>
          This parameter represents claims of the end-user. "Claims" here are pieces of information about
          the end-user such as `"name"`, `"email"` and `"birthdate"`. The authorization server implementation
          is required to gather claims of the end-user, format the claim values into JSON and set the JSON
          string as the value of this parameter.

          The claims which the authorization server implementation is required to gather are listed in
          `claims` parameter in the `/auth/authorization` API response.

          For example, if claims parameter lists `"name"`, `"email"` and `"birthdate"`, the value of this
          parameter should look like the following.

          ```json
          {
            "name": "John Smith",
            "email": "john@example.com",
            "birthdate": "1974-05-06"
          }
          ```

          `claimsLocales` parameter in the `/auth/authorization` API response lists the end-user's preferred
          languages and scripts, ordered by preference. When `claimsLocales` parameter is a non-empty array,
          its elements should be taken into account when the authorization server implementation gathers
          claim values. Especially, note the excerpt below from [5.2. Claims Languages and Scripts](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClaimsLanguagesAndScripts)
          of OpenID Connect Core 1.0.

          > When the OP determines, either through the `claims_locales` parameter, or by other means, that
          the End-User and Client are requesting Claims in only one set of languages and scripts, it is
          RECOMMENDED that OPs return Claims without language tags when they employ this language and script.
          It is also RECOMMENDED that Clients be written in a manner that they can handle and utilize Claims
          using language tags.

          If `claims` parameter in the `/auth/authorization` API response is `null` or an empty array,
          the value of this parameter should be `null`.

          See [5.1. Standard Claims](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims)
          of OpenID Connect core 1.0 for claim names and their value formats. Note (1) that the authorization
          server implementation support its special claims ([5.1.2. Additional Claims](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AdditionalClaims))
          and (2) that claim names may be followed by a language tag ([5.2. Claims Languages and Scripts](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClaimsLanguagesAndScripts)).
          Read the specification of [OpenID Connect Core 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html)
          for details.

          The claim values in this parameter will be embedded in an ID token.

          Note that `idTokenClaims` parameter is available in the `/auth/authorization` API response.
          The parameter has the value of the `"id_token"` property in the `claims` request parameter or
          in the `"claims"` property in a request object. The value of this parameter should be considered
          when you prepare claim values.

        - <u>`properties` (optional)</u><br>
          Extra properties to associate with an access token and/or an authorization code that may be issued
          by this request. Note that `properties` parameter is accepted only when `Content-Type` of the
          request is `application/json`, so don't use `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` for details.

        - <u>`scopes` (optional)</u><br>
          Scopes to associate with an access token and/or an authorization code. If this parameter is `null`,
          the scopes specified in the original authorization request from the client application are used.
          In other cases, including the case of an empty array, the specified scopes will replace the original
          scopes contained in the original authorization request.

          Even scopes that are not included in the original authorization request can be specified. However,
          as an exception, `openid` scope is ignored on the server side if it is not included in the original
          request. It is because the existence of `openid` scope considerably changes the validation steps
          and because adding `openid` triggers generation of an ID token (although the client application
          has not requested it) and the behavior is a major violation against the specification.

          If you add `offline_access` scope although it is not included in the original request, keep in
          mind that the specification requires explicit consent from the user for the scope ([OpenID Connect
          Core 1.0, 11. Offline Access](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#OfflineAccess)).
          When `offline_access` is included in the original request, the current implementation of Authlete's
          `/auth/authorization` API checks whether the request has come along with `prompt` request parameter
          and the value includes consent. However, note that the implementation of Authlete's `/auth/authorization/issue`
          API does not perform such checking if `offline_access` scope is added via this `scopes` parameter.

        - <u>`sub` (optional)</u><br>
          The value of the `sub` claim in an ID token. If the value of this request parameter is not empty,
          it is used as the value of the `sub` claim. Otherwise, the value of the `subject` request parameter
          is used as the value of the `sub` claim. The main purpose of this parameter is to hide the actual
          value of the subject from client applications.

          Note that even if this `sub` parameter is not empty, the value of the subject request parameter
          is used as the value of the subject which is associated with the access token.

        **INTERACTION**

        When the value of `action` is `INTERACTION`, it means that the request from the client application
        has no problem and requires the service to process the request with user interaction by an HTML form.
        The purpose of the UI displayed to the end-user is to ask the end-user to grant authorization to
        the client application. The items described below are some points which the service implementation
        should take into account when it builds the UI.

        [1] DISPLAY MODE

        The response from `/auth/authorization` API has `display` parameter. It is one of `PAGE` (default),
        `POPUP`, `TOUCH` and `WAP` The meanings of the values are described in [3.1.2.1. Authentication
        Request of OpenID Connect Core 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest).
        Basically, the authorization server implementation should display the UI which is suitable for the
        display mode, but it is okay for the authorization server implementation to "attempt to detect the
        capabilities of the User Agent and present an appropriate display".

        It is ensured that the value of `display` is one of the supported display modes which are specified
        by `supportedDisplays` configuration parameter of the service.

        [2] UI LOCALE

        The response from `/auth/authorization` API has `uiLocales` parameter. It it is not `null`, it lists
        language tag values (such as `fr-CA`, `ja-JP` and `en`) ordered by preference. The service implementation
        should display the UI in one of the language listed in the parameter when possible. It is ensured
        that language tags listed in `uiLocales` are contained in the list of supported UI locales which
        are specified by `supportedUiLocales` configuration parameter of the service.

        [3] CLIENT INFORMATION

        The authorization server implementation should show information about the client application to
        the end-user. The information is embedded in `client` parameter in the response from `/auth/authorization`
        API.

        [4] SCOPES

        A client application requires authorization for specific permissions. In OAuth 2.0 specification,
        "scope" is a technical term which represents a permission. `scopes` parameter in the response
        from `/auth/authorization` API is a list of scopes requested by the client application. The service
        implementation should show the end-user the scopes.

        The authorization server implementation may choose not to show scopes to which the end-user has
        given consent in the past. To put it the other way around, the authorization server implementation
        may show only the scopes to which the end-user has not given consent yet. However, if the value
        of `prompts` response parameter contains `CONSENT`, the authorization server implementation has
        to obtain explicit consent from the end-user even if the end-user has given consent to all the
        requested scopes in the past.

        Note that Authlete provides APIs to manage records of granted scopes (`/api/client/granted_scopes/*`
        APIs), but the APIs work only in the case the Authlete server you use is a dedicated Authlete server
        (contact sales@authlete.com for details). In other words, the APIs of the shared Authlete server
        are disabled intentionally (in order to prevent garbage data from being accumulated) and they
        return 403 Forbidden.

        It is ensured that the values in `scopes` parameter are contained in the list of supported scopes
        which are specified by `supportedScopes` configuration parameter of the service.

        [5] DYNAMIC SCOPES

        The authorization request may include dynamic scopes. The list of recognized dynamic scopes are
        accessible by getDynamicScopes() method. See the description of the [DynamicScope](https://authlete.github.io/authlete-java-common/com/authlete/common/dto/DynamicScope.html)
        class for details about dynamic scopes.

        [6] AUTHORIZATION DETAILS

        The authorization server implementation should show the end-user "authorization details" if the
        request includes it. The value of `authorization_details` parameter in the response is the content
        of the `authorization_details` request parameter.

        See "OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization Requests" for details.

        [7] PURPOSE

        The authorization server implementation must show the value of the `purpose` request parameter if
        it supports [OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-4-identity-assurance-1_0.html).
        See [8. Transaction-specific Purpose](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-4-identity-assurance-1_0.html#rfc.section.8)
        in the specification for details.

        Note that the value of `purpose` response parameter is the value of the purpose request parameter.

        [7] END-USER AUTHENTICATION

        Necessarily, the end-user must be authenticated (= must login the service) before granting authorization
        to the client application. Simply put, a login form is expected to be displayed for end-user authentication.
        The service implementation must follow the steps described below to comply with OpenID Connect.
        (Or just always show a login form if it's too much of a bother.)

        (i) Get the value of `prompts` response parameter. It corresponds to the value of the `prompt`
        request parameter. Details of the request parameter are described in [3.1.2.1. Authentication
        Request](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest) of OpenID Connect Core 1.0.

        (ii) If the value of `prompts` parameter is `SELECT_ACCOUNT` display a form to let the end-user
        select on of his/her accounts for login. If `subject` response parameter is not `null`, it is the
        end-user ID that the client application expects, so the value should be used to determine the value
        of the login ID. Note that a subject and a login ID are not necessarily equal. If the value of
        `subject` response parameter is `null`, the value of `loginHint` response parameter should be referred
        to as a hint to determine the value of the login ID. The value of `loginHint` response parameter
        is simply the value of the `login_hint` request parameter.

        (iii) If the value of `prompts` response parameter contains `LOGIN`, display a form to urge the
        end-user to login even if the end-user has already logged in. If the value of `subject` response
        parameter is not `null`, it is the end-user ID that the client application expects, so the value
        should be used to determine the value of the login ID. Note that a subject and a login ID are not
        necessarily equal. If the value of `subject` response parameter is `null`, the value of `loginHint`
        response parameter should be referred to as a hint to determine the value of the login ID. The value
        of `loginHint` response parameter is simply the value of the `login_hint` request parameter.

        (iv) If the value of `prompts` response parameter does not contain `LOGIN`, the authorization server
        implementation does not have to authenticate the end-user if all the conditions described below
        are satisfied. If any one of the conditions is not satisfied, show a login form to authenticate
        the end-user.

        - An end-user has already logged in the service.

        - The login ID of the current end-user matches the value of `subject` response parameter.
        This check is required only when the value of `subject` response parameter is a non-null value.

        - The max age, which is the number of seconds contained in `maxAge` response parameter,
        has not passed since the current end-user logged in your service. This check is required only when
        the value of `maxAge` response parameter is a non-zero value.

        - If the authorization server implementation does not manage authentication time of end-users
        (= if the authorization server implementation cannot know when end-users logged in) and if the
        value of `maxAge` response parameter is a non-zero value, a login form should be displayed.

        - The ACR (Authentication Context Class Reference) of the authentication performed for
        the current end-user satisfies one of the ACRs listed in `acrs` response parameter. This check is
        required only when the value of `acrs` response parameter is a non-empty array.

        In every case, the end-user authentication must satisfy one of the ACRs listed in `acrs` response
        parameter when the value of `acrs` response parameter is a non-empty array and `acrEssential`
        response parameter is `true`.

        [9] GRANT/DENY BUTTONS

        The end-user is supposed to choose either (1) to grant authorization to the client application or
        (2) to deny the authorization request. The UI must have UI components to accept the judgment by
        the user. Usually, a button to grant authorization and a button to deny the request are provided.

        When the value of `subject` response parameter is not `null`, the end-user authentication must be
        performed for the subject, meaning that the authorization server implementation should repeatedly
        show a login form until the subject is successfully authenticated.

        The end-user will choose either (1) to grant authorization to the client application or (2) to
        deny the authorization request. When the end-user chose to deny the authorization request, call
        Authlete's `/auth/authorization/fail` API with `reason=DENIED` and use the response from the API
        to generate a response to the client application.

        When the end-user chose to grant authorization to the client application, the authorization server
        implementation has to issue an authorization code, an ID token, and/or an access token to the client
        application. (There is a special case. When `response_type=none`, nothing is issued.) Issuing the
        tokens can be performed by calling Authlete's `/auth/authorization/issue` API. Read [ISSUE] written
        above in the description for the case of `action=NO_INTERACTION`.

      description: |
        This API generates a content of an error authorization response that the authorization server implementation
        returns to the client application.

        <br>
        <details>
        <summary>Description</summary>

        This API is supposed to be called from within the implementation of the authorization endpoint of the service
        in order to generate an error response to the client application.

        The description of the `/auth/authorization` API describes the timing when this API should be called.

        The response from `/auth/authorization/fail` API has some parameters.
        Among them, it is `action` parameter that the authorization server implementation should check first because
        it denotes the next action that the authorization server implementation should take.
        According to the value of `action`, the authorization server implementation must take the steps described below.

        **INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR**

        When the value of `action` is `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`, it means that the request from the authorization
        server implementation was wrong or that an error occurred in Authlete.

        In either case, from the viewpoint of the client application, it is an error on the server side.
        Therefore, the service implementation should generate a response to the client application with
        HTTP status of "500 Internal Server Error". Authlete recommends `application/json` as the content type.

        The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used
        as the entity body of the response.

        The following illustrates the response which the service implementation should generate and return
        to the client application.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
        Content-Type: application/json
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache

        {responseContent}
        ```

        The endpoint implementation may return another different response to the client application since
        "500 Internal Server Error" is not required by OAuth 2.0.

        **BAD_REQUEST**

        When the value of `action` is `BAD_REQUEST`, it means that the ticket is no longer valid (deleted
        or expired) and that the reason of the invalidity was probably due to the end-user's too-delayed
        response to the authorization UI.

        A response with HTTP status of "400 Bad Request" should be returned to the client application and
        Authlete recommends `application/json` as the content type.

        The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used
        as the entity body of the response.

        The following illustrates the response which the service implementation should generate and return
        to the client application.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
        Content-Type: application/json
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache

        {responseContent}
        ```

        The endpoint implementation may return another different response to the client application since
        "400 Bad Request" is not required by OAuth 2.0.

        **LOCATION**

        When the value of `action` is `LOCATION`, it means that the response to the client application must
        be "302 Found" with Location header.

        The parameter responseContent contains a redirect URI with (1) an authorization code, an ID token
        and/or an access token (on success) or (2) an error code (on failure), so it can be used as the
        value of `Location` header.

        The following illustrates the response which the service implementation must generate and return
        to the client application.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 302 Found
        Location: {responseContent}
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache
        ```

        **FORM**

        When the value of `action` is `FORM`, it means that the response to the client application must be 200 OK
        with an HTML which triggers redirection by JavaScript.
        This happens when the authorization request from the client application contained `response_mode=form_post`.

        The value of `responseContent` is an HTML which can be used as the entity body of the response.

        The following illustrates the response which the service implementation must generate and return
        to the client application.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Content-Type: text/html;charset=UTF-8
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache

        {responseContent}
        ```

        Therefore, the service implementation should generate a response to the client application with
        HTTP status of "500 Internal Server Error".

        The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used as
        the entity body of the response.

        The following illustrates the response which the service implementation should generate and return
        to the client application.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
        Content-Type: application/json
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache

        {responseContent}
        ```

        The endpoint implementation may return another different response to the client application since
        "500 Internal Server Error" is not required by OAuth 2.0.

        **BAD_REQUEST**

        When the value of "action" is `BAD_REQUEST`, it means that the ticket is no longer valid (deleted
        or expired) and that the reason of the invalidity was probably due to the end-user's too-delayed
        response to the authorization UI.

        The HTTP status of the response returned to the client application should be "400 Bad Request"
        and the content type should be `application/json` although OAuth 2.0 specification does not mention
        the format of the error response.

        The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used as
        the entity body of the response.

        The following illustrates the response which the service implementation should generate and return
        to the client application.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
        Content-Type: application/json
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache

        {responseContent}
        ```

        The endpoint implementation may return another different response to the client application since
        "400 Bad Request" is not required by OAuth 2.0.

        **LOCATION**

        When the value of `action` is `LOCATION`, it means that the response to the client application
        should be "302 Found" with `Location` header.

        The value of `responseContent` is a redirect URI which contains (1) an authorization code, an ID
        token and/or an access token (on success) or (2) an error code (on failure), so it can be used as
        the value of `Location` header.

        The following illustrates the response which the service implementation must generate and return
        to the client application.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 302 Found
        Location: {responseContent}
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache
        ```

        **FORM**

        When the value of `action` is `FORM`, it means that the response to the client application should
        be "200 OK" with an HTML which triggers redirection by JavaScript. This happens when the authorization
        request from the client contains `response_mode=form_post` request parameter.

        The value of `responseContent` is an HTML which satisfies the requirements of `response_mode=form_post`,
        so it can be used as the entity body of the response.

        The following illustrates the response which the service implementation should generate and return
        to the client application.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Content-Type: text/html;charset=UTF-8
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache

        {responseContent}
        ```

      description: "This API parses request parameters of an authorization request\
        \ and returns necessary data for the\nauthorization server implementation\
        \ to process the authorization request further.\n\n<br>\n<details>\n<summary>Description</summary>\n\
        \nThis API is supposed to be called from with the implementation of the token\
        \ endpoint of the service.\nThe endpoint implementation must extract the request\
        \ parameters from the token request from the\nclient application and pass\
        \ them as the value of parameters request parameter to Authlete's `/auth/token`\
        \ API.\nThe value of parameters is the entire entity body (which is formatted\
        \ in `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`)\nof the token request.\n\nIn addition,\
        \ if the token endpoint of the authorization server implementation supports\
        \ basic authentication\nas a means of [client authentication](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-2.3),\n\
        the client credentials must be extracted from `Authorization` header and they\
        \ must be passed as\n`clientId` request parameter and `clientSecret` request\
        \ parameter to Authlete's `/auth/token` API.\n\nThe following code snippet\
        \ is an example in JAX-RS showing how to extract request parameters from\n\
        the token request and client credentials from Authorization header.\n\n```java\n\
        @POST\n@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_FORM_URLENCODED)\npublic Response post(\n\
        \        @HeaderParam(HttpHeaders.AUTHORIZATION) String auth,\n        String\
        \ parameters)\n{\n    // Convert the value of Authorization header (credentials\
        \ of\n    // the client application), if any, into BasicCredentials.\n   \
        \ BasicCredentials credentials = BasicCredentials.parse(auth);\n\n    // The\
        \ credentials of the client application extracted from\n    // 'Authorization'\
        \ header. These may be null.\n    String clientId     = credentials == null\
        \ ? null\n                        : credentials.getUserId();\n    String clientSecret\
        \ = credentials == null ? null\n                        : credentials.getPassword();\n\
        \n    // Process the given parameters.\n    return process(parameters, clientId,\
        \ clientSecret);\n}\n```\n\nThe response from `/auth/token` API has some parameters.\
        \ Among them, it is action parameter that\nthe service implementation should\
        \ check first because it denotes the next action that the authorization\n\
        server implementation should take. According to the value of action, the authorization\
        \ server\nimplementation must take the steps described below.\n\n**INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR**\n\
        \nWhen the value of `action` is `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`, it means that the\
        \ request from the authorization\nserver implementation was wrong or that\
        \ an error occurred in Authlete.\nIn either case, from the viewpoint of the\
        \ client application, it is an error on the server side.\nTherefore, the service\
        \ implementation should generate a response to the client application with\n\
        HTTP status of \"500 Internal Server Error\". Authlete recommends `application/json`\
        \ as the content\ntype although OAuth 2.0 specification does not mention the\
        \ format of the error response when the\nredirect URI is not usable.\n\nThe\
        \ value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so\
        \ it can be\nused as the entity body of the response.\n\nThe following illustrates\
        \ the response which the service implementation should generate and return\n\
        to the client application.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error\nContent-Type:\
        \ application/json\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n\n{responseContent}\n\
        ```\n\nThe endpoint implementation may return another different response to\
        \ the client application\nsince \"500 Internal Server Error\" is not required\
        \ by OAuth 2.0.\n\n\n**INVALID_CLIENT**\n\nWhen the value of `action` is `INVALID_CLIENT`,\
        \ it means that authentication of the client failed.\nIn this case, the HTTP\
        \ status of the response to the client application is either \"400 Bad Request\"\
        \nor \"401 Unauthorized\". This requirement comes from [RFC 6749, 5.2. Error\
        \ Response](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-5.2).\n\
        The description about `invalid_client` shown below is an excerpt from RFC\
        \ 6749.\n\nClient authentication failed (e.g., unknown client, no client authentication\
        \ included, or unsupported\nauthentication method). The authorization server\
        \ MAY return an HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) status code\nto indicate which HTTP\
        \ authentication schemes are supported. If the client attempted to authenticate\n\
        via the `Authorization` request header field, the authorization server MUST\
        \ respond with an HTTP\n401 (Unauthorized) status code and include the `WWW-Authenticate`\
        \ response header field matching\nthe authentication scheme used by the client.\n\
        \nIn either case, the value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which can\
        \ be used as the entity\nbody of the response to the client application.\n\
        \nThe following illustrate responses which the service implementation must\
        \ generate and return to\nthe client application.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 400 Bad\
        \ Request\nContent-Type: application/json\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma:\
        \ no-cache\n\n{responseContent}\n```\n\n<br>\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\n\
        WWW-Authenticate: {challenge}\nContent-Type: application/json\nCache-Control:\
        \ no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n\n{responseContent}\n```\n\n**BAD_REQUEST**\n\
        \nWhen the value of `action` is `BAD_REQUEST`, it means that the request from\
        \ the client application\nis invalid.\n\nA response with HTTP status of \"\
        400 Bad Request\" must be returned to the client application and\nthe content\
        \ type must be `application/json`.\n\nThe value of `responseContent` is a\
        \ JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used as\nthe entity\
        \ body of the response.\n\nThe following illustrates the response which the\
        \ service implementation should generate and return\nto the client application.\n\
        \n```\nHTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\nContent-Type: application/json\nCache-Control:\
        \ no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n\n{responseContent}\n```\n**PASSWORD**\n\nWhen\
        \ the value of {@code \"action\"} is {@code \"PASSWORD\"}, it means that\n\
        the request from the client application is valid and {@code grant_type}\n\
        is {@code \"password\"}. That is, the flow is\n<a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html#section-4.3\"\
        >\"Resource Owner\nPassword Credentials\"</a>.\n\nIn this case, {@link #getUsername()}\
        \ returns the value of {@code \"username\"}\nrequest parameter and {@link\
        \ #getPassword()} returns the value of {@code\n\"password\"} request parameter\
        \ which were contained in the token request\nfrom the client application.\
        \ The service implementation must validate the\ncredentials of the resource\
        \ owner (= end-user) and take either of the\nactions below according to the\
        \ validation result.\n\n1. When the credentials are valid, call Authlete's\
        \ /auth/token/issue} API to generate an access token for the client\n    application.\
        \ The API requires {@code \"ticket\"} request parameter and\n    {@code \"\
        subject\"} request parameter.\n    Use the value returned from {@link #getTicket()}\
        \ method as the value\n    for {@code \"ticket\"} parameter.\n2. The response\
        \ from {@code /auth/token/issue} API ({@link\n    TokenIssueResponse}) contains\
        \ data (an access token and others)\n    which should be returned to the client\
        \ application. Use the data\n    to generate a response to the client application.\n\
        3. When the credentials are invalid</b>, call Authlete's {@code\n    /auth/token/fail}\
        \ API with {@code reason=}{@link\n    TokenFailRequest.Reason#INVALID_RESOURCE_OWNER_CREDENTIALS\n\
        \    INVALID_RESOURCE_OWNER_CREDENTIALS} to generate an error response\n \
        \   for the client application. The API requires {@code \"ticket\"}\n    request\
        \ parameter. Use the value returned from {@link #getTicket()}\n    method\
        \ as the value for {@code \"ticket\"} parameter.\n4. The response from {@code\
        \ /auth/token/fail} API ({@link\n    TokenFailResponse}) contains error information\
        \ which should be\n    returned to the client application. Use it to generate\
        \ a response\n    to the client application.\n\n**OK**\n\nWhen the value of\
        \ `action` is `OK`, it means that the request from the client application\
        \ is valid\nand an access token, and optionally an ID token, is ready to be\
        \ issued.\n\nThe HTTP status of the response returned to the client application\
        \ must be \"200 OK\" and the content\ntype must be `application/json`.\n\n\
        The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which contains an access token\
        \ (and optionally\nan ID token), so it can be used as the entity body of the\
        \ response.\n\nThe following illustrates the response which the service implementation\
        \ must generate and return\nto the client application.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200\
        \ OK\nContent-Type: application/json\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n\
        \n{responseContent}\n```\n\n  \n**TOKEN_EXCHANGE (Authlete 2.3 onwards)**\n\
        \nWhen the value of {@code \"action\"} is {@code \"TOKEN_EXCHANGE\"}, it means\n\
        that the request from the client application is a valid token exchange\nrequest\
        \ (cf. <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8693.html\">RFC\n8693 OAuth\
        \ 2.0 Token Exchange</a>) and that the request has already passed\nthe following\
        \ validation steps.\n\n\n1. Confirm that the value of the {@code requested_token_type}\
        \ request parameter\nis one of the registered token type identifiers if the\
        \ request parameter is\ngiven and its value is not empty.\n2. Confirm that\
        \ the {@code subject_token} request parameter is given and its\nvalue is not\
        \ empty.\n3. Confirm that the {@code subject_token_type} request parameter\
        \ is given and\nits value is one of the registered token type identifiers.\n\
        4. Confirm that the {@code actor_token_type} request parameter is given and\n\
        its value is one of the registered token type identifiers if the\n{@code actor_token}\
        \ request parameter is given and its value is not empty.\n5. Confirm that\
        \ the {@code actor_token_type} request parameter is not given\nor its value\
        \ is empty when the {@code actor_token} request parameter is\nnot given or\
        \ its value is empty.\n\n\nFurthermore, Authlete performs additional validation\
        \ on the tokens specified\nby the {@code subject_token} request parameter\
        \ and the {@code actor_token}\nrequest parameter according to their respective\
        \ token types as shown below.\n\n**Token Validation Steps**\n\n*Token Type:\
        \ `urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt`* \n\n1. Confirm that the format conforms\
        \ to the JWT specification [RFC 7519][https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519.html].\n\
        2. Check if the JWT is encrypted and if it is encrypted, then (a) reject\n\
        \        the token exchange request when the {@link\n        Service#isTokenExchangeEncryptedJwtRejected()\n\
        \        tokenExchangeEncryptedJwtRejected} flag of the service is {@code\
        \ true}\n        or (b) skip remaining validation steps when the flag is {@code\
        \ false}.\n        Note that Authlete does not verify an encrypted JWT because\
        \ there is\n        no standard way to obtain the key to decrypt the JWT with.\
        \ This means\n        that you must verify an encrypted JWT by yourself when\
        \ one is used as\n        an input token with the token type\n        { @code\
        \ \"urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt\" }.\n3. Confirm that the current\
        \ time has not reached the time indicated by\n        the {@code exp} claim\
        \ if the JWT contains the claim.\n4. Confirm that the current time is equal\
        \ to or after the time indicated\n        by the {@code iat} claim if the\
        \ JWT contains the claim.\n5.Confirm that the current time is equal to or\
        \ after the time indicated\n        by the {@code nbf} claim if the JWT contains\
        \ the claim.\n6. Check if the JWT is signed and if it is not signed, then\
        \ (a) reject\n        the token exchange request when the {@link\n       \
        \ Service#isTokenExchangeUnsignedJwtRejected()\n        tokenExchangeUnsignedJwtRejected}\
        \ flag of the service is {@code true}\n        or (b) finish validation on\
        \ the input token. Note that Authlete does\n        not verify the signature\
        \ of the JWT because there is no standard way\n        to obtain the key to\
        \ verify the signature of a JWT with. This means\n        that you must verify\
        \ the signature by yourself when a signed JWT is\n        used as an input\
        \ token with the token type\n        {@code \"urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt\"\
        }.\n\n*Token Type: `urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token`*\n\n1.\
        \ Confirm that the token is an access token that has been issued by\n    \
        \    the Authlete server of your service. This implies that access\n     \
        \   tokens issued by other systems cannot be used as a subject token\n   \
        \     or an actor token with the token type\n        <code>urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token</code>.\n\
        2. Confirm that the access token has not expired.\n3. Confirm that the access\
        \ token belongs to the service.\n\n*Token Type: `urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:refresh_token`*\n\
        \n1. Confirm that the token is a refresh token that has been issued by\n \
        \       the Authlete server of your service. This implies that refresh\n \
        \       tokens issued by other systems cannot be used as a subject token\n\
        \        or an actor token with the token type\n        <code>urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:refresh_token</code>.\n\
        2. Confirm that the refresh token has not expired.\n3. Confirm that the refresh\
        \ token belongs to the service.\n\n*Token Type: `urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id_token`*\n\
        \n1. Confirm that the format conforms to the JWT specification (<a href=\n\
        \        \"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519.html\">RFC 7519</a>).\n\
        2. Check if the ID Token is encrypted and if it is encrypted, then (a)\n \
        \       reject the token exchange request when the {@link\n        Service#isTokenExchangeEncryptedJwtRejected()\n\
        \        tokenExchangeEncryptedJwtRejected} flag of the service is {@code\
        \ true}\n        or (b) skip remaining validation steps when the flag is {@code\
        \ false}.\n        Note that Authlete does not verify an encrypted ID Token\
        \ because\n        there is no standard way to obtain the key to decrypt the\
        \ ID Token\n        with in the context of token exchange where the client\
        \ ID for the\n        encrypted ID Token cannot be determined. This means\
        \ that you must\n        verify an encrypted ID Token by yourself when one\
        \ is used as an\n        input token with the token type\n        {@code \"\
        urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id_token\"}.\n3. Confirm that the ID Token\
        \ contains the {@code exp} claim and the\n        current time has not reached\
        \ the time indicated by the claim.\n4. Confirm that the ID Token contains\
        \ the {@code iat} claim and the\n        current time is equal to or after\
        \ the time indicated by the claim.\n5. Confirm that the current time is equal\
        \ to or after the time indicated\n        by the {@code nbf} claim if the\
        \ ID Token contains the claim.\n6. Confirm that the ID Token contains the\
        \ {@code iss} claim and the\n        value is a valid URI. In addition, confirm\
        \ that the URI has the\n        {@code https} scheme, no query component and\
        \ no fragment component.\n7. Confirm that the ID Token contains the {@code\
        \ aud} claim and its\n        value is a JSON string or an array of JSON strings.\n\
        8. Confirm that the value of the {@code nonce} claim is a JSON string\n  \
        \      if the ID Token contains the claim.\n9. Check if the ID Token is signed\
        \ and if it is not signed, then (a)\n        reject the token exchange request\
        \ when the {@link\n        Service#isTokenExchangeUnsignedJwtRejected()\n\
        \        tokenExchangeUnsignedJwtRejected} flag of the service is {@code true}\n\
        \        or (b) finish validation on the input token.\n10. Confirm that the\
        \ signature algorithm is asymmetric. This implies that\n        ID Tokens\
        \ whose signature algorithm is symmetric ({@code HS256},\n        {@code HS384}\
        \ or {@code HS512}) cannot be used as a subject token or\n        an actor\
        \ token with the token type\n        {@code urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id_token}.\n\
        11. Verify the signature of the ID Token. Signature verification is\n    \
        \    performed even in the case where the issuer of the ID Token is not\n\
        \        your service. But in that case, the issuer must support the discovery\n\
        \        endpoint defined in <a href=\n        \"https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html\"\
        >OpenID\n        Connect Discovery 1.0</a>. Otherwise, signature verification\
        \ fails.\n\n*Token Type: `urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:saml1`*\n\n(Authlete\
        \ does not perform any validation for this token type.)\n\n*Token Type: `urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:saml2`*\n\
        \n(Authlete does not perform any validation for this token type.)\n\nThe specification\
        \ of Token Exchange (<a href=\n\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8693.html\"\
        >RFC 8693</a>) is very\nflexible. In other words, the specification has abandoned\
        \ the task of\ndetermining details. Therefore, for secure token exchange,\
        \ you have\nto complement the specification with your own rules. For that\
        \ purpose,\nAuthlete provides some configuration options as listed below.\n\
        Authorization server implementers may utilize them and/or implement\ntheir\
        \ own rules.\n\n\nIn the case of {@link Action#TOKEN_EXCHANGE TOKEN_EXCHANGE},\
        \ the {@link\n#getResponseContent()} method returns {@code null}. You have\
        \ to construct\nthe token response by yourself.\n\nFor example, you may generate\
        \ an access token by calling Authlete's\n{@code /api/auth/token/create} API\
        \ and construct a token response like\nbelow.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\n\
        WWW-Authenticate: {challenge}\nContent-Type: application/json\nCache-Control:\

        This API generates a content of an error token response that the authorization server implementation
        returns to the client application.

        <br>
        <details>
        <summary>Description</summary>

        This API is supposed to be called from within the implementation of the token endpoint of the service
        in order to generate an error response to the client application.

        The description of the `/auth/token` API describes the timing when this API should be called. See
        the description for the case of `action=PASSWORD`.

        The response from `/auth/token/fail` API has some parameters. Among them, it is `action` parameter
        that the authorization server implementation should check first because it denotes the next action
        that the authorization server implementation should take. According to the value of `action`, the
        authorization server implementation must take the steps described below.

        **INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR**

        When the value of `action` is `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`, it means that the request from the authorization
        server implementation was wrong or that an error occurred in Authlete.

        In either case, from the viewpoint of the client application, it is an error on the server side.
        Therefore, the service implementation should generate a response to the client application with
        HTTP status of "500 Internal Server Error".

        The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used
        as the entity body of the response.

        The following illustrates the response which the service implementation should generate and return
        to the client application.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
        Content-Type: application/json
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache

        {responseContent}
        ```

        The endpoint implementation may return another different response to the client application
        since "500 Internal Server Error" is not required by OAuth 2.0.

        **BAD_REQUEST**

        When the value of `action` is `BAD_REQUEST`, it means that Authlete's `/auth/token/fail` API successfully
        generated an error response for the client application.

        The HTTP status of the response returned to the client application must be "400 Bad Request" and
        the content type must be `application/json`.

        The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used
        as the entity body of the response.

        The following illustrates the response which the service implementation should generate and return
        to the client application.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
        Content-Type: application/json
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache

        {responseContent}

        This API generates a content of a successful token response that the authorization server implementation
        returns to the client application.

        <br>
        <details>
        <summary>Description</summary>

        This API is supposed to be called from within the implementation of the token endpoint of the service
        in order to generate a successful response to the client application.

        The description of the `/auth/token` API describes the timing when this API should be called. See
        the description for the case of `action=PASSWORD`.

        The response from `/auth/token/issue` API has some parameters. Among them, it is `action` parameter
        that the authorization server implementation should check first because it denotes the next action
        that the authorization server implementation should take. According to the value of `action`, the
        authorization server implementation must take the steps described below.

        **INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR**

        When the value of `action` is `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`, it means that the request from the authorization
        server implementation was wrong or that an error occurred in Authlete.

        In either case, from the viewpoint of the client application, it is an error on the server side.
        Therefore, the service implementation should generate a response to the client application with
        HTTP status of "500 Internal Server Error".

        The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used
        as the entity body of the response.

        The following illustrates the response which the service implementation should generate and return
        to the client application.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
        Content-Type: application/json
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache

        {responseContent}
        ```

        The endpoint implementation may return another different response to the client application
        since "500 Internal Server Error" is not required by OAuth 2.0.

        **OK**

        When the value of `action` is `OK`, it means that Authlete's `/auth/token/issue` API successfully
        generated an access token.

        The HTTP status of the response returned to the client application must be "200 OK" and the content
        type must be`application/json`.

        The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which contains an access token, so it can be used
        as the entity body of the response.

        The following illustrates the response which the service implementation must generate and return
        to the client application.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Content-Type: application/json
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache

        {responseContent}
        ```

        This API gathers information about an access token.

        <br>
        <details>
        <summary>Description</summary>

        This API is supposed to be called from within the implementations of protected resource endpoints
        of the authorization server implementation in order to get information about the access token which
        was presented by the client application.

        In general, a client application accesses a protected resource endpoint of a service with an access
        token, and the implementation of the endpoint checks whether the presented access token has enough
        privileges (= scopes) to access the protected resource before returning the protected resource to
        the client application. To achieve this flow, the endpoint implementation has to know detailed
        information about the access token. Authlete `/auth/introspection` API can be used to get such information.

        The response from `/auth/introspection` API has some parameters. Among them, it is `action` parameter
        that the authorization server implementation should check first because it denotes the next action
        that the authorization server implementation should take. According to the value of `action`, the
        authorization server implementation must take the steps described below.

        **INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR**

        When the value of `action` is `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`, it means that the request from the authorization
        server implementation was wrong or that an error occurred in Authlete.
        In either case, from the viewpoint of the client application, it is an error on the server side.
        Therefore, the service implementation should generate a response to the client application with
        HTTP status of "500 Internal Server Error". Authlete recommends `application/json` as the content
        type although OAuth 2.0 specification does not mention the format of the error response when the
        redirect URI is not usable.

        The value of `responseContent` is a string which describes the error in the format of
        [RFC 6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage), so if
        the protected resource of the service implementation wants to return an error response to the client
        application in the way that complies with RFC 6750 (in other words, if `accessTokenType` configuration
        parameter of the service is Bearer), the value of `responseContent` can be used as the value of
        `WWW-Authenticate` header.

        The following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
        Content-Type: application/json
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache

        {responseContent}
        ```

        **BAD_REQUEST**

        When the value of `action` is `BAD_REQUEST`, it means that the request from the client application
        does not contain an access token (= the request from the authorization server implementation to
        Authlete does not contain `token` request parameter).

        A response with HTTP status of "400 Bad Request" must be returned to the client application and
        the content type must be `application/json`.


        The value of `responseContent` is a string which describes the error in the format of [RFC
        6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage), so if the
        protected resource of the service implementation wants to return an error response to the client
        application in the way that complies with RFC 6750 (in other words, if `accessTokenType` configuration
        parameter of the service is `Bearer`), the value of `responseContent` can be used as the value of
        `WWW-Authenticate` header.

        The following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
        WWW-Authenticate: {responseContent}
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache
        ```

        **UNAUTHORIZED**

        When the value of `action` is `UNAUTHORIZED`, it means that the access token does not exist or has
        expired.

        The value of `responseContent` is a string which describes the error in the format of RFC
        6750 (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage), so if the protected resource of the service implementation
        wants to return an error response to the client application in the way that complies with [RFC
        6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) (in other words, if `accessTokenType` configuration
        parameter of the service is `Bearer`), the value of `responseContent` can be used as the value of
        `WWW-Authenticate` header.

        The following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
        WWW-Authenticate: {responseContent}
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache
        ```

        **FORBIDDEN**

        When the value of `action` is `FORBIDDEN`, it means that the access token does not cover the required
        scopes or that the subject associated with the access token is different from the subject contained
        in the request.

        A response with HTTP status of "400 Bad Request" must be returned to the client application and
        the content type must be `application/json`.

        The value of `responseContent` is a string which describes the error in the format of [RFC
        6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage), so if the
        protected resource of the service implementation wants to return an error response to the client
        application in the way that complies with RFC 6750 (in other words, if `accessTokenType` configuration
        parameter of the service is Bearer), the value of `responseContent` can be used as the value of
        `WWW-Authenticate` header.

        The following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
        WWW-Authenticate: {responseContent}
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache
        ```

        **OK**

        When the value of `action` is `OK`, it means that the access token which the client application
        presented is valid (= exists and has not expired).

        The implementation of the protected resource endpoint is supposed to return the protected resource
        to the client application.

        When action is `OK`, the value of `responseContent` is `"Bearer error=\"invalid_request\""`. This
        is the simplest string which can be used as the value of `WWW-Authenticate` header to indicate
        "400 Bad Request". The implementation of the protected resource endpoint may use this string to
        tell the client application that the request was bad (e.g. in case necessary request parameters
        for the protected resource endpoint are missing). However, in such a case, the implementation
        should generate a more informative error message to help developers of client applications.

        The following is an example error response which complies with RFC 6750.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
        WWW-Authenticate: {responseContent}
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache
        ```

        Basically, The value of `responseContent` is a string which describes the error in the format of
        [RFC 6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage). So, if
        the service has selected `Bearer` as the value of `accessTokenType` configuration parameter, the
        value of `responseContent` can be used directly as the value of `WWW-Authenticate` header. However,
        if the service has selected another different token type, the service has to generate error messages
        for itself.

        _**JWT-based access token**_

        Since version 2.1, Authlete provides a feature to issue access tokens in JWT format. This feature
        can be enabled by setting a non-null value to the `accessTokenSignAlg` property of the service
        (see the description of the Service class for details). `/api/auth/introspection` API can accept
        access tokens in JWT format. However, note that the API does not return information contained in
        a given JWT-based access token but returns information stored in the database record which corresponds
        to the given JWT-based access token. Because attributes of the database record can be modified
        after the access token is issued (for example, by using `/api/auth/token/update` API), information
        returned by `/api/auth/introspection` API and information the given JWT-based access token holds
        may be different.

        This API exists to help your authorization server provide its own introspection API which complies
        with [RFC 7662](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7662) (OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection).

        <br>
        <details>
        <summary>Description</summary>

        This API is supposed to be called from within the implementations of the introspection endpoint
        of your service. The authorization server implementation should retrieve the value of `action` from
        the response and take the following steps according to the value.

        In general, a client application accesses a protected resource endpoint of a service with an access
        token, and the implementation of the endpoint checks whether the presented access token has enough
        privileges (= scopes) to access the protected resource before returning the protected resource to
        the client application. To achieve this flow, the endpoint implementation has to know detailed
        information about the access token. Authlete `/auth/introspection` API can be used to get such information.

        The response from `/auth/introspection` API has some parameters. Among them, it is `action` parameter
        that the authorization server implementation should check first because it denotes the next action
        that the authorization server implementation should take. According to the value of `action`, the
        authorization server implementation must take the steps described below.

        **INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR**

        When the value of `action` is `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`, it means that the request from the authorization
        server implementation was wrong or that an error occurred in Authlete.

        In either case, from the viewpoint of the client application, it is an error on the server side.
        Therefore, the service implementation should generate a response to the client application with
        HTTP status of "500 Internal Server Error".

        The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used
        as the entity body of the response if you want. Note that, however, [RFC 7662](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7662) does not mention anything about the response
        body of error responses.

        The following illustrates an example response which the introspection endpoint of the authorization
        server implementation generates and returns to the client application.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
        Content-Type: application/json

        {responseContent}
        ```

        **BAD_REQUEST**

        When the value of `action` is `BAD_REQUEST`, it means that the request from the client application
        is invalid. This happens when the request from the client did not include the token request parameter.
        See "[2.1. Introspection Request](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7662#section-2.1)" in
        RFC 7662 for details about requirements for introspection requests.

        The HTTP status of the response returned to the client application should be "400 Bad Request".

        The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used
        as the entity body of the response if you want. Note that, however, [RFC 7662](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7662)
        does not mention anything about the response body of error responses.

        The following illustrates an example response which the introspection endpoint of the authorization
        server implementation generates and returns to the client application.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
        Content-Type: application/json

        {responseContent}
        ```

        **OK**

        When the value of `action` is `OK`, the request from the client application is valid.

        The HTTP status of the response returned to the client application must be "200 OK" and its content
        type must be `application/json`.

        The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which complies with the introspection response
        defined in "2.2. Introspection Response" in RFC7662.

        The following illustrates the response which the introspection endpoint of your authorization server
        implementation should generate and return to the client application.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Content-Type: application/json

        {responseContent}
        ```

        Note that RFC 7662 says _"To prevent token scanning attacks, **the endpoint MUST also require some
        form of authorization to access this endpoint**"_. This means that you have to protect your introspection
        endpoint in some way or other. Authlete does not care about how your introspection endpoint is protected.
        In most cases, as mentioned in RFC 7662, "401 Unauthorized" is a proper response when an introspection
        request does not satisfy authorization requirements imposed by your introspection endpoint.

        This API revokes access tokens and refresh tokens.

        <br>
        <details>
        <summary>Description</summary>

        This API is supposed to be called from within the implementation of the revocation endpoint ([RFC
        7009](tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7009)) of the authorization server implementation in order to revoke
        access tokens and refresh tokens.

        The response from `/auth/revocation` API has some parameters. Among them, it is `action` parameter
        that the authorization server implementation should check first because it denotes the next action
        that the authorization server implementation should take. According to the value of `action`, the
        authorization server implementation must take the steps described below.

        **INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR**

        When the value of `action` is `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`, it means that the request from the authorization
        server implementation was wrong or that an error occurred in Authlete.
        In either case, from the viewpoint of the client application, it is an error on the server side.
        Therefore, the service implementation should generate a response to the client application with
        HTTP status of "500 Internal Server Error".

        The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be
        used as the entity body of the response.

        The following illustrates the response which the service implementation should generate and return
        to the client application.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
        Content-Type: application/json
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache

        {responseContent}
        ```

        **INVALID_CLIENT**

        When the value of `action` is `INVALID_CLIENT`, it means that authentication of the client failed.
        In this case, the HTTP status of the response to the client application is either "400 Bad Request"
        or "401 Unauthorized". The description about `invalid_client` shown below is an excerpt from [RFC
        6749](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749).

        `invalid_client`

        > Client authentication failed (e.g., unknown client, no client authentication included, or unsupported
        authentication method). The authorization server MAY return an HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) status code
        to indicate which HTTP authentication schemes are supported. If the client attempted to authenticate
        via the `Authorization` request header field, the authorization server MUST respond with an HTTP
        401 (Unauthorized) status code and include the `WWW-Authenticate` response header field matching
        the authentication scheme used by the client.

        In either case, the value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which can be used as the entity
        body of the response to the client application.

        The following illustrates the response which the service implementation should generate and return
        to the client application.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
        Content-Type: application/json
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache

        {responseContent}
        ```

        <br>

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
        WWW-Authenticate: {challenge}
        Content-Type: application/json
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache

        {responseContent}
        ```

        **BAD_REQUEST**

        When the value of `action` is `BAD_REQUEST`, it means that the request from the client application
        is invalid.

        The HTTP status of the response returned to the client application must be "400 Bad Request" and
        the content type must be `application/json`. [RFC 7009](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7009),
        [2.2.1. Error Respons](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7009#section-2.2.1) states "The
        error presentation conforms to the definition in [Section 5.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-5.2)
        of [[RFC 6749](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749)]."

        The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used
        as the entity body of the response.

        The following illustrates the response which the authorization server implementation should generate
        and return to the client application.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
        Content-Type: application/json
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache

        {responseContent}
        ```

        **OK**

        When the value of `action` is `OK`, it means that the request from the client application is valid
        and the presented token has been revoked successfully or if the client submitted an invalid token.
        Note that invalid tokens do not cause an error. See [2.2. Revocation Response](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7009#section-2.2) for details.

        The HTTP status of the response returned to the client application must be 200 OK.

        If the original request from the client application contains callback request parameter and its
        value is not empty, the content type should be `application/javascript` and the content should be
        a JavaScript snippet for JSONP.

        The value of `responseContent` is JavaScript snippet if the original request from the client application
        contains callback request parameter and its value is not empty. Otherwise, the value of `responseContent`
        is `null`.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Content-Type: application/javascript
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache

        {responseContent}
        ```

        This API gathers information about a user.

        <br>
        <details>
        <summary>Description</summary>

        This API is supposed to be called from within the implementation of the [userinfo endpoint](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo)
        of the authorization server in order to get information about the user that is associated with
        an access token.

        The response from `/auth/userinfo` API has various parameters. Among them, it is `action` parameter
        that the authorization server implementation should check first because it denotes the next action
        that the authorization server implementation should take. According to the value of `action`, the
        service implementation must take the steps described below.

        **INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR**

        When the value of `action` is `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`, it means that the request from the authorization
        server implementation was wrong or that an error occurred in Authlete. In either case, from the
        viewpoint of the client application, it is an error on the server side. Therefore, the service
        implementation should generate a response to the client application with HTTP status of "500 Internal
        Server Error".

        The value of `responseContent` is a string which describes the error in the format of [RFC 6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750)
        (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage) so the userinfo endpoint implementation can use the value of `responseContent`
        as the value of`WWW-Authenticate` header.

        The following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750. Note that OpenID Connect Core
        1.0 requires that an error response from userinfo endpoint comply with RFC 6750. See [5.3.3. UserInfo
        Response](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfoError) for details.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
        WWW-Authenticate: {responseContent}
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache
        ```

        **BAD_REQUEST**

        When the value of `action` is `BAD_REQUEST`, it means that the request from the client application
        does not contain an access token (= the request from the authorization server implementation to
        Authlete does not contain `token` parameter).

        The value of `responseContent` is a string which describes the error in the format
        of [RFC 6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage) so the
        userinfo endpoint implementation can use the value of `responseContent` as the value of`WWW-Authenticate`
        header.

        The following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750. Note that OpenID Connect Core
        1.0 requires that an error response from userinfo endpoint comply with RFC 6750. See [5.3.3. UserInfo
        Response](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfoError) for details.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
        WWW-Authenticate: {responseContent}
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache
        ```

        **UNAUTHORIZED**

        When the value of `action` is `UNAUTHORIZED`, it means that the access token does not exist, has
        expired, or is not associated with any subject (= any user account).

        The value of `responseContent` is a string which describes the error in the format of [RFC
        6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage) so the userinfo
        endpoint implementation can use the value of `responseContent` as the value of`WWW-Authenticate`
        header.

        The following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750. Note that OpenID Connect Core
        1.0 requires that an error response from userinfo endpoint comply with RFC 6750. See [5.3.3. UserInfo
        Response](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfoError) for details.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
        WWW-Authenticate: {responseContent}
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache
        ```

        **FORBIDDEN**

        When the value of `action` is `FORBIDDEN`, it means that the access token does not include the
        `openid` scope.

        The value of `responseContent` is a string which describes the error in the format of [RFC 6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750)
        (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage) so the userinfo endpoint implementation can use the value of `responseContent`
        as the value of`WWW-Authenticate` header.

        The following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750. Note that OpenID Connect Core
        1.0 requires that an error response from userinfo endpoint comply with RFC 6750. See [5.3.3. UserInfo
        Response](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfoError) for details.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
        WWW-Authenticate: {responseContent}
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache
        ```

        **OK**

        When the value of `action` is `OK`, it means that the access token which the client application
        presented is valid. To be concrete, it means that the access token exists, has not expired, includes
        the openid scope, and is associated with a subject (= a user account).

        What the userinfo endpoint implementation should do next is to collect information about the subject
        (user) from your database. The value of the `subject` is contained in the subject parameter in the
        response from this API and the names of data, i.e., the claims names are contained in the claims
        parameter in the response. For example, if the `subject` parameter is `joe123` and the claims
        parameter is `[ "given_name", "email" ]`, you need to extract information about joe123's given name
        and email from your database.

        Then, call Authlete's `/auth/userinfo/issue` API with the collected information and the access token
        in order to make Authlete generate an ID token.

        If an error occurred during the above steps, generate an error response to the client. The response
        should comply with [RFC 6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750). For example, if the
        subject associated with the access token does not exist in your database any longer, you may feel
        like generating a response like below.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
        WWW-Authenticate: Bearer error="invalid_token",
         error_description="The subject associated with the access token does not exist."
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache
        ```

        Also, an error might occur on database access. If you treat the error as an internal server error,
        then the response would be like the following.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
        WWW-Authenticate: Bearer error="server_error",

        This API generates an ID token.

        <br>
        <details>
        <summary>Description</summary>

        This API is supposed to be called from within the implementation of the [userinfo endpoint](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo)
        of the authorization server in order to generate an ID token. Before calling this API, a valid
        response from `/auth/userinfo` API must be obtained. Then, call this API with the access token
        contained in the response and the claims values of the user (subject) associated with the access
        token. See **OK** written in the description of `/auth/userinfo` API for details.

        The response from `/auth/userinfo/issue` API has various parameters. Among them, it is `action`
        parameter that the authorization server implementation should check first because it denotes the
        next action that the authorization server implementation should take. According to the value of
        `action`, the service implementation must take the steps described below.

        **INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR**

        When the value of `action` is `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`, it means that the request from the authorization
        server implementation was wrong or that an error occurred in Authlete. In either case, from the
        viewpoint of the client application, it is an error on the server side. Therefore, the service
        implementation should generate a response to the client application with HTTP status of "500 Internal
        Server Error".

        The parameter `responseContent` returns a string which describes the error in the format of [RFC
        6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage) so the userinfo
        endpoint implementation can use the value of `responseContent` as the value of`WWW-Authenticate`
        header.

        The following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750. Note that OpenID Connect Core
        1.0 requires that an error response from userinfo endpoint comply with RFC 6750. See [5.3.3. UserInfo
        Response](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfoError) for details.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
        WWW-Authenticate: {responseContent}
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache
        ```

        **BAD_REQUEST**

        When the value of `action` is `BAD_REQUEST`, it means that the request from the client application
        does not contain an access token (= the request from the authorization server implementation to
        Authlete does not contain `token` parameter).

        The parameter `responseContent` returns a string which describes the error in the format of [RFC
        6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage) so the userinfo
        endpoint implementation can use the value of `responseContent` as the value of`WWW-Authenticate`
        header.

        The following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750. Note that OpenID Connect Core
        1.0 requires that an error response from userinfo endpoint comply with RFC 6750. See [5.3.3. UserInfo
        Response](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfoError) for details.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
        WWW-Authenticate: {responseContent}
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache
        ```

        **UNAUTHORIZED**

        When the value of `action` is `UNAUTHORIZED`, it means that the access token does not exist, has
        expired, or is not associated with any subject (= any user account).

        The parameter `responseContent` returns a string which describes the error in the format of [RFC
        6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage) so the userinfo
        endpoint implementation can use the value of `responseContent` as the value of`WWW-Authenticate`
        header.

        The following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750. Note that OpenID Connect Core
        1.0 requires that an error response from userinfo endpoint comply with RFC 6750. See [5.3.3. UserInfo
        Response](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfoError) for details.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
        WWW-Authenticate: {responseContent}
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache
        ```

        **FORBIDDEN**

        When the value of `action` is `FORBIDDEN`, it means that the access token does not include the
        `openid` scope.

        The parameter `responseContent` returns a string which describes the error in the format of [RFC
        6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage) so the userinfo
        endpoint implementation can use the value of `responseContent` as the value of`WWW-Authenticate`
        header.

        The following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750. Note that OpenID Connect Core
        1.0 requires that an error response from userinfo endpoint comply with RFC 6750. See [5.3.3. UserInfo
        Response](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfoError) for details.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
        WWW-Authenticate: {responseContent}
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache
        ```

        **JSON**

        When the value of `action` is `JSON`, it means that the access token which the client application
        presented is valid and an ID token was successfully generated in the format of JSON.

        The userinfo endpoint implementation is expected to generate a response to the client application.
        The content type of the response must be `application/json` and the response body must be an ID
        token in JSON format.

        The value of `responseContent` is the ID token in JSON format when `action` is `JSON`, so
        a response to the client can be built like below.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache
        Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8

        {responseContent}
        ```

        **JWT**

        When the value of `action` is `JWT`, it means that the access token which the client application
        presented is valid and an ID token was successfully generated in the format of JWT (JSON Web Token)
        ([RFC 7519](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519)).

        The userinfo endpoint implementation is expected to generate a response to the client application.
        The content type of the response must be `application/jwt` and the response body must be an ID
        token in JWT format.

        The value of `responseContent` is the ID token in JSON format when `action` is `JWT`, so a response
        to the client can be built like below.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache
        Content-Type: application/jwt

        {responseContent}
        ```

        Register a client. This API is supposed to be used to implement a client registration endpoint that
        complies with [RFC 7591](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591) (OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client
        Registration Protocol).

        <br>
        <details>
        <summary>Description</summary>

        This API is supposed to be called from the within the implementation of the client registration
        endpoint of the authorization server. The authorization server implementation should retrieve
        the value of `action` from the response and take the following steps according to the value.

        **INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR**

        When the value of `action` is `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`, it means that the API call from the authorization
        server implementation was wrong or that an error occurred in Authlete.

        In either case, from a viewpoint of the client or developer, it is an error on the server side.
        Therefore, the authorization server implementation should generate a response with "500 Internal
        Server Error"s and `application/json`.

        The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used as
        the entity body of the response.

        The following illustrates the response which the authorization server implementation should generate
        and return to the client or developer.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
        Content-Type: application/json
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache

        {responseContent}
        ```

        The endpoint implementation may return another different response to the client or developer since
        "500 Internal Server Error" is not required by the specification.

        **BAD_REQUEST**

        When the value of `action` is `BAD_REQUEST`, it means that the request from the client or developer
        was wrong.

        The authorization server implementation should generate a response with "400 Bad Request" and `application/json`.

        The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used
        as the entity body of the response.

        The following illustrates the response which the authorization server implementation should generate
        and return to the client or developer.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
        Content-Type: application/json
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache

        {responseContent}
        ```

        **CREATED**

        When the value of `action` is `CREATED`, it means that the request from the client or developer is
        valid.

        The authorization server implementation should generate a response to the client or developer with
        "201 CREATED" and `application/json`.

        The `responseContent` a JSON string which can be used as the entity body of the response.

        The following illustrates the response which the authorization server implementation should generate
        and return to the client or developer.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 201 CREATED
        Content-Type: application/json
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache

        {responseContent}
        ```

        Get a dynamically registered client. This API is supposed to be used to implement a client registration
        management endpoint that complies with [RFC 7592](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7592)
        (OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Registration Management).

        <br>
        <details>
        <summary>Description</summary>

        This API is supposed to be called from the within the implementation of the client registration
        management endpoint of the authorization server. The authorization server implementation should
        retrieve the value of `action` from the response and take the following steps according to the value.

        **INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR**

        When the value of `action` is `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`, it means that the API call from the authorization
        server implementation was wrong or that an error occurred in Authlete.

        In either case, from a viewpoint of the client or developer, it is an error on the server side.
        Therefore, the authorization server implementation should generate a response to the client or developer
        with "500 Internal Server Error"s and `application/json`.

        The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used as
        the entity body of the response.

        The following illustrates the response which the authorization server implementation should generate
        and return to the client or developer.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
        Content-Type: application/json
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache

        {responseContent}
        ```

        The endpoint implementation may return another different response to the client or developer since
        "500 Internal Server Error" is not required by the specification.

        **BAD_REQUEST**

        When the value of `action` is `BAD_REQUEST`, it means that the request from the client or developer
        was wrong.

        The authorization server implementation should generate a response to the client or developer with
        "400 Bad Request" and `application/json`.

        The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used as
        the entity body of the response.

        The following illustrates the response which the authorization server implementation should generate
        and return to the client or developer.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
        Content-Type: application/json
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache

        {responseContent}
        ```

        **UNAUTHORIZED**

        When the value of `action` is `UNAUTHORIZED`, it means that the registration access token used by
        the client configuration request (RFC 7592) is invalid, or the client application which the token
        is tied to does not exist any longer or is invalid.

        The HTTP status of the response returned to the client application must be "401 Unauthorized" and
        the content type must be `application/json`.

        The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used as
        the entity body of the response.

        The following illustrates the response which the endpoint implementation should generate and return
        to the client application.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
        Content-Type: application/json
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache

        {responseContent}
        ```

        NOTE: The `UNAUTHORIZED` value was added in October, 2021. See the description of
        `Service.unauthorizedOnClientConfigSupported` for details.

        **OK**

        When the value of `action` is `OK`, it means that the request from the client or developer is valid.

        The authorization server implementation should generate a response to the client or developer with
        "200 OK" and `application/json`.

        The `responseContent` a JSON string which can be used as the entity body of the response.

        The following illustrates the response which the authorization server implementation should generate
        and return to the client or developer.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Content-Type: application/json
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache

        {responseContent}
        ```

        Update a dynamically registered client. This API is supposed to be used to implement a client
        registration management endpoint that complies with [RFC 7592](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7592)
        (OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Registration Management).

        <br>
        <details>
        <summary>Description</summary>

        This API is supposed to be called from the within the implementation of the client registration
        management endpoint of the authorization server. The authorization server implementation should
        retrieve the value of `action` from the response and take the following steps according to the value.

        **INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR**

        When the value of `action` is `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`, it means that the API call from the authorization
        server implementation was wrong or that an error occurred in Authlete.

        In either case, from a viewpoint of the client or developer, it is an error on the server side.
        Therefore, the authorization server implementation should generate a response with "500 Internal
        Server Error"s and `application/json`.

        The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used as
        the entity body of the response.

        The following illustrates the response which the authorization server implementation should generate
        and return to the client or developer.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
        Content-Type: application/json
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache

        {responseContent}
        ```

        The endpoint implementation may return another different response to the client or developer since
        "500 Internal Server Error" is not required by the specification.

        **BAD_REQUEST**

        When the value of `action` is `BAD_REQUEST`, it means that the request from the client or developer
        was wrong.

        The authorization server implementation should generate a response with "400 Bad Request" and `application/json`.

        The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used as
        the entity body of the response.

        The following illustrates the response which the authorization server implementation should generate
        and return to the client or developer.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
        Content-Type: application/json
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache

        {responseContent}
        ```

        **UNAUTHORIZED**

        When the value of `action` is `UNAUTHORIZED`, it means that the registration access token used by
        the client configuration request (RFC 7592) is invalid, or the client application which the token
        is tied to does not exist any longer or is invalid.

        The HTTP status of the response returned to the client application must be "401 Unauthorized" and
        the content type must be `application/json`.

        The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used as
        the entity body of the response.

        The following illustrates the response which the endpoint implementation should generate and return
        to the client application.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
        Content-Type: application/json
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache

        {responseContent}
        ```

        NOTE: The `UNAUTHORIZED` value was added in October, 2021. See the description of
        `Service.unauthorizedOnClientConfigSupported` for details.

        **UPDATED**

        When the value of `action` is `UPDATED`, it means that the request from the client or developer is
        valid.

        The authorization server implementation should generate a response to the client or developer with
        "200 OK" and `application/json`.

        The `responseContent` a JSON string which can be used as the entity body of the response.

        The following illustrates the response which the authorization server implementation should generate
        and return to the client or developer.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Content-Type: application/json
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache

        {responseContent}

        was wrong.

        The authorization server implementation should generate a response with "400 Bad Request" and `application/json`.

        The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used as
        the entity body of the response.

        The following illustrates the response which the authorization server implementation should generate

        {responseContent}
        ```

        **UNAUTHORIZED**

        When the value of `action` is `UNAUTHORIZED`, it means that the registration access token used by
        the client configuration request (RFC 7592) is invalid, or the client application which the token
        is tied to does not exist any longer or is invalid.

        The HTTP status of the response returned to the client application must be "401 Unauthorized" and

        `Service.unauthorizedOnClientConfigSupported` for details.

        **DELETED**

        When the value of `action` is `DELETED`, it means that the request from the client or developer is
        valid.

        The authorization server implementation should generate a response to the client or developer with
        "204 No Content".

        The following illustrates the response which the authorization server implementation should generate

  /api/{serviceApiKey}/backchannel/authentication:
    post:
      description: |
        This API parses request parameters of a [backchannel authentication request](https://openid.net/specs/openid-client-initiated-backchannel-authentication-core-1_0.html#auth_request)
        and returns necessary data for the authorization server implementation to process the backchannel
        authentication request further.

        <br>
        <details>
        <summary>Description</summary>

        This API is supposed to be called from within the implementation of the [backchannel authentication
        endpoint](https://openid.net/specs/openid-client-initiated-backchannel-authentication-core-1_0.html#auth_backchannel_endpoint)
        of the service. The endpoint implementation must extract the request parameters from the
        backchannel authentication request from the client application and pass them as the value of parameters
        request parameter for Authlete's `/backchannel/authentication` API.

        The value of parameters is the entire entity body (which is formatted in `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`)
        of the request from the client application.

        The following code snippet is an example in JAX-RS showing how to extract request parameters from
        the backchannel authentication request.

        ```java
        @POST
        @Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_FORM_URLENCODED)
        public Response post(String parameters)
        {
            // 'parameters' is the entity body of the backchannel authentication request.
            ......
        }
        ```

        The endpoint implementation does not have to parse the request parameters from the client application
        because Authlete's `/backchannel/authentication` API does it.

        The response from `/backchannel/authentication` API has various parameters. Among them, it is `action`
        parameter that the authorization server implementation should check first because it denotes the
        next action that the authorization server implementation should take. According to the value of
        `action`, the service implementation must take the steps described below.

        **INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR**

        When the value of `action` is `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`, it means that the request from the authorization
        server implementation was wrong or that an error occurred in Authlete.
        In either case, from the viewpoint of the client application, it is an error on the server side.
        Therefore, the service implementation should generate a response to the client application with
        HTTP status of "500 Internal Server Error" and `application/json`.

        The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used
        as the entity body of the response.

        The following illustrates the response which the service implementation should generate and return
        to the client application.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
        Content-Type: application/json
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache

        {responseContent}
        ```

        **BAD_REQUEST**

        When the value of `action` is `BAD_REQUEST`, it means that the request from the client application
        is invalid.

        The authorization server implementation should generate a response to the client application with
        "400 Bad Request" and `application/json`.

        The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used as
        the entity body of the response.

        The following illustrates the response which the service implementation should generate and return
        to the client application.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
        Content-Type: application/json
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache

        {responseContent}
        ```

        **UNAUTHORIZED**

        When the value of `action` is `UNAUTHORIZED`, it means that client authentication of the backchannel
        authentication request failed. Note that client authentication is always required at the backchannel
        authentication endpoint. This implies that public clients are not allowed to use the backchannel
        authentication endpoint.

        The authorization server implementation should generate a response to the client application with
        "401 Unauthorized" and `application/json`.

        The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used as
        the entity body of the response.

        The following illustrates the response which the service implementation must generate and return
        to the client application.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
        WWW-Authenticate: (challenge)
        Content-Type: application/json
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache

        {responseContent}
        ```

        **USER_IDENTIFICATION**

        When the value of `action` is `USER_IDENTIFICATION`, it means that the backchannel authentication
        request from the client application is valid. The authorization server implementation has to follow
        the steps below.

        [1] END-USER IDENTIFICATION

        The first step is to determine the subject (= unique identifier) of the end-user from whom the
        client application wants to get authorization.

        According to the CIBA specification, a backchannel authentication request contains one (and only
        one) of the `login_hint_token`, `id_token_hint` and `login_hint` request parameters as a hint
        by which the authorization server identifies the subject of an end-user.<br>
        The authorization server implementation can know which hint is included in the backchannel authentication
        request by the `hintType` parameter. For example, when the value of the parameter `LOGIN_HINT`,
        it means that the backchannel authentication request contains the `login_hint` request parameter
        as a hint.<br>

        The value of the `hint` parameter is the value of the hint. For example, when the value of the
        `hintType` parameter is `LOGIN_HINT`, The value of the `hint` parameter is the value of the `login_hint`
        request parameter.<br>

        It is up to the authorization server implementation how to determine the subject of the end-user
        from the hint. Only when the `id_token_hint` request parameter is used, authorization server
        implementation can use the sub response parameter, which holds the value of the sub claim in the
        `id_token_hint` request parameter.

        [2] END-USER IDENTIFICATION ERROR

        There are some cases where the authorization server implementation encounters an error during
        the user identification process. In any error case, the service implementation has to return an
        HTTP response with the error response parameter to the client application. The following is an
        example of such error responses.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
        Content-Type: application/json
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache

        { "error":"unknown_user_id" }
        ```

        Authlete provides `/backchannel/authentication/fail` API that builds the response body (JSON)
        of an error response. However, because it is easy to build an error response manually, you may
        choose not to call the API. One good thing in using the API is that the API call can trigger
        deletion of the ticket which has been issued from Authlete's `/backchannel/authentication` API.
        If you don't call `/backchannel/authentication/fail` API, the ticket will continue to exist in
        the database until it is cleaned up by the batch program after the ticket expires.<br>

        Possible error cases that the authorization server implementation itself has to handle are as
        follows. Other error cases have already been covered by `/backchannel/authentication` API.

        - <u>`expired_login_hint_token`</u><br>
          The authorization server implementation detected that the hint presented by the `login_hint_token`
          request parameter has expired.

          Note that the format of `login_hint_token` is not described in the CIBA Core spec at all and
          so there is no consensus on how to detect expiration of `login_hint_token`. Interpretation
          of `login_hint_token` is left to each authorization server implementation.

        - <u>`unknown_user_id`</u><br>
          The authorization server implementation could not determine the subject of the end-user by
          the presented hint.

        - <u>`unauthorized_client`</u><br>
          The authorization server implementation has custom rules to reject backchannel authentication
          requests from some particular clients and found that the client which has made the backchannel
          authentication request is one of the particular clients.

          Note that `/backchannel/authentication` API does not return `action=USER_IDENTIFICATION` in
          cases where the client does not exist or client authentication has failed. Therefore, the
          authorization server implementation will never have to use the error code `unauthorized_client`
          unless the server has intentionally implemented custom rules to reject backchannel authentication
          requests based on clients.

        - <u>`missing_user_code`</u><br>
          The authorization server implementation has custom rules to require that a backchannel authentication
          request include a user code for some particular users and found that the user identified by
          the hint is one of the particular users.

          Note that `/backchannel/authentication` API does not return `action=USER_IDENTIFICATION` when
          both the `backchannel_user_code_parameter_supported` metadata of the server and the
          `backchannel_user_code_parameter` metadata of the client are true and the backchannel authentication
          request does not include the user_code request parameter. In this case, `/backchannel/authentication`
          API returns action=BAD_REQUEST with JSON containing `"error":"missing_user_code"`. Therefore,
          the authorization server implementation will never have to use the error code `missing_user_code`
          unless the server has intentionally implemented custom rules to require a user code based
          on users even in the case where the `backchannel_user_code_parameter` metadata of the client
          which has made the backchannel authentication request is `false`.

        - <u>`invalid_user_code`</u><br>
          The authorization server implementation detected that the presented user code is invalid.

          Note that the format of user_code is not described in the CIBA Core spec at all and so there
          is no consensus on how to judge whether a user code is valid or not. It is up to each authorization
          server implementation how to handle user codes.

        - <u>`invalid_binding_message`</u><br>
          The authorization server implementation detected that the presented binding message is invalid.

          Note that the format of binding_message is not described in the CIBA Core spec at all and
          so there is no consensus on how to judge whether a binding message is valid or not. It is
          up to each authorization server implementation how to handle binding messages.

        - <u>`invalid_target`</u><br>
          The authorization server implementation rejects the requested target resources.

          The error code invalid_target is from "Resource Indicators for OAuth 2.0". The specification
          defines the resource request parameter. By using the parameter, client applications can request
          target resources that should be bound to the access token being issued. If the authorization
          server wants to reject the request, call `/backchannel/authentication/fail` API with `INVALID_TARGET`.

        - <u>`access_denined`</u><br>
          The authorization server implementation has custom rules to reject backchannel authentication
          requests without asking the end-user and respond to the client as if the end-user had rejected
          the request in some particular cases and found that the backchannel authentication request
          is one of the particular cases.

          The authorization server implementation will never have to use the error code `access_denied`
          at this timing unless the server has intentionally implemented custom rules to reject backchannel
          authentication requests without asking the end-user and respond to the client as if the end-user
          had rejected the request.

        [3] AUTH_REQ_ID ISSUE

        If the authorization server implementation has successfully determined the subject of the end-user,
        the next action is to return an HTTP response to the client application which contains `auth_req_id`.

        Authlete provides `/backchannel/authentication/issue` API which generates a JSON containing `auth_req_id`,
        so, your next action is (1) call the API, (2) receive the response from the API, (3) build a response
        to the client application using the content of the API response, and (4) return the response to
        the client application. See the description of `/backchannel/authentication/issue` API for details.

        [4] END-USER AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION

        After sending a JSON containing `auth_req_id` back to the client application, the service implementation
        starts to communicate with an authentication device of the end-user. It is assumed that end-user
        authentication is performed on the authentication device and the end-user confirms the content of
        the backchannel authentication request and grants authorization to the client application if everything
        is okay. The authorization server implementation must be able to receive the result of the end-user
        authentication and authorization from the authentication device.

        How to communicate with an authentication device and achieve end-user authentication and authorization
        is up to each authorization server implementation, but the following request parameters of the backchannel
        authentication request should be taken into consideration in any implementation.

        - <u>`acr_values`</u><br>
          A backchannel authentication request may contain an array of ACRs (Authentication Context Class
          References) in preference order. If multiple authentication devices are registered for the end-user,
          the authorization server implementation should take the ACRs into consideration when selecting
          the best authentication device.

        - <u>`scope`</u><br>
          A backchannel authentication request always contains a list of scopes. At least, `openid` is
          included in the list (otherwise `/backchannel/authentication` API returns `action=BAD_REQUEST`).
          It would be better to show the requested scopes to the end-user on the authentication device
          or somewhere appropriate.

          If the scope request parameter contains `address`, `email`, `phone` and/or `profile`, they are
          interpreted as defined in "5.4. Requesting Claims using Scope Values of OpenID Connect Core 1.0".
          That is, they are expanded into a list of claim names. The claimNames parameter returns the expanded
          result.

        - <u>`binding_message`</u><br>
          A backchannel authentication request may contain a binding message. It is a human readable identifier
          or message intended to be displayed on both the consumption device (client application) and the
          authentication device.

        - <u>`user_code`</u><br>
          A backchannel authentication request may contain a user code. It is a secret code, such as password
          or pin, known only to the end-user but verifiable by the authorization server. The user code should
          be used to authorize sending a request to the authentication device.

        [5] END-USER AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION COMPLETION

        After receiving the result of end-user authentication and authorization, the authorization server
        implementation must call Authlete's `/backchannel/authentication/complete` API to tell Authlete
        the result and pass necessary data so that Authlete can generate an ID token, an access token and
        optionally a refresh token. See the description of the API for details.

        [6] CLIENT NOTIFICATION

        When the backchannel token delivery mode is either `ping` or `push`, the authorization server implementation
        must send a notification to the pre-registered notification endpoint of the client after the end-user
        authentication and authorization. In this case, the `action` parameter in a response from `/backchannel/authentication/complete`
        API is `NOTIFICATION`. See the description of `/backchannel/authentication/complete` API for details.

        [7] TOKEN REQUEST

        When the backchannel token delivery mode is either `ping` or `poll`, the client application will make
        a token request to the token endpoint to get an ID token, an access token and optionally a refresh
        token.

        A token request that corresponds to a backchannel authentication request uses `urn:openid:params:grant-type:ciba`
        as the value of the `grant_type` request parameter. Authlete's `/auth/token` API recognizes the
        grant type automatically and behaves properly, so the existing token endpoint implementation does
        not have to be changed to support CIBA.

        This API prepares JSON that contains an `auth_req_id`. The JSON should be used as the response body
        of the response which is returned to the client from the [backchannel authentication endpoint](https://openid.net/specs/openid-client-initiated-backchannel-authentication-core-1_0.html#auth_backchannel_endpoint)

        <br>
        <details>
        <summary>Description</summary>

        This API is supposed to be called from within the implementation of the backchannel authentication
        endpoint of the service in order to generate a successful response to the client application.

        The description of the `/backchannel/authentication` API describes the timing when this API should
        be called and the meaning of request parameters. See [AUTH_REQ_ID ISSUE] in `USER_IDENTIFICATION`.

        The response from `/backchannel/authentication/issue` API has some parameters. Among them, it is
        `action` parameter that the authorization server implementation should check first because it denotes
        the next `action` that the authorization server implementation should take. According to the value
        of `action`, the authorization server implementation must take the steps described below.

        ```java
        @POST
        @Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_FORM_URLENCODED)
        public Response post(String parameters)
        {
            // 'parameters' is the entity body of the backchannel authentication request.
            ......
        }
        ```

        The endpoint implementation does not have to parse the request parameters from the client application
        because Authlete's `/backchannel/authentication` API does it.

        The response from `/backchannel/authentication` API has various parameters. Among them, it is `action`
        parameter that the authorization server implementation should check first because it denotes the
        next action that the authorization server implementation should take. According to the value of
        `action`, the service implementation must take the steps described below.

        **INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR**

        When the value of `action` is `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`, it means that the request from the authorization
        server implementation was wrong or that an error occurred in Authlete.
        In either case, from the viewpoint of the client application, it is an error on the server side.
        Therefore, the service implementation should generate a response to the client application with
        HTTP status of "500 Internal Server Error" and `application/json`.

        The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used as
        the entity body of the response.

        The following illustrates the response which the service implementation should generate and return
        to the client application.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
        Content-Type: application/json
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache

        {responseContent}
        ```

        **INVALID_TICKET**

        When the value of `action` is `INVALID_TICKET`, it means that the ticket included in the API call
        was invalid. For example, it does not exist or has expired.

        From a viewpoint of the client application, this is an error on the server side. Therefore, the
        authorization server implementation should generate a response to the client application with
        "500 Internal Server Error" and `application/json`.

        You can build an error response in the same way as shown in the description for the case of `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`.

        **OK**

        When the value of `action` is `OK`, it means that Authlete has succeeded in preparing JSON that
        contains an `auth_req_id`. The JSON should be used as the response body of the response that is
        returned to the client from the backchannel authentication endpoint. `responseContent` contains
        the JSON.

        The following illustrates the response which the authorization server implementation should generate
        and return to the client application.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Content-Type: text/html;charset=UTF-8
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache

        {responseContent}
        ```

        The API prepares JSON that contains an error. The JSON should be used as the response body of the
        response which is returned to the client from the [backchannel authentication endpoint](https://openid.net/specs/openid-client-initiated-backchannel-authentication-core-1_0.html#auth_backchannel_endpoint).

        <br>
        <details>
        <summary>Description</summary>

        This API is supposed to be called from within the implementation of the [backchannel authentication
        endpoint](https://openid.net/specs/openid-client-initiated-backchannel-authentication-core-1_0.html#auth_backchannel_endpoint)
        of the service in order to generate an error response to the client application.

        The response from `/backchannel/authentication/fails` API has some parameters. Among them, it is
        `action` parameter that the authorization server implementation should check first because it denotes
        the next action that the authorization server implementation should take. According to the value
        of `action`, the authorization server implementation must take the steps described below.

        **INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR**

        When the value of `action` is `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`, it means that (1) the `reason` request parameter
        of the API call was `SERVER_ERROR`, (2) an error occurred on Authlete side, or (3) the request parameters
        of the API call were wrong. In this case, the authorization server implementation should return
        a "500 Internal Server Error" response to the client application. However, in most cases, commercial
        implementations prefer to use other HTTP status code than 5xx.

        **BAD_REQUEST**

        When the value of `action` is `BAD_REQUEST`, the authorization server implementation should return a
        "400 Bad Request" response to the client application.

        **FORBIDDEN**

        When the value of `action` is `FORBIDDEN`, it means that the `reason` request parameter of the API call
        was `ACCESS_DENIED`. In this case, the backchannel authentication endpoint of the authorization
        server implementation should return a "403 Forbidden" response to the client application.

  /api/{serviceApiKey}/backchannel/authentication/complete:
    post:
      description: |
        This API returns information about what action the authorization server should take after it receives
        the result of end-user's decision about whether the end-user has approved or rejected a client application's
        request on the authentication device.

        <br>
        <details>
        <summary>Description</summary>

        After the implementation of the backchannel authentication endpoint returns JSON containing an
        `auth_req_id` to the client, the authorization server starts a background process that communicates
        with the authentication device of the end-user. On the authentication device, end-user authentication
        is performed and the end-user is asked whether they give authorization to the client or not. The
        authorization server will receive the result of end-user authentication and authorization from
        the authentication device.

        After the authorization server receives the result from the authentication device, or even in the
        case where the server gave up receiving a response from the authentication device for some reasons,
        the server should call the `/backchannel/authentication/complete` API to tell Authlete the result.

        When the end-user was authenticated and authorization was granted to the client by the end-user,
        the authorization server should call the API with `result=AUTHORIZED`. In this successful case,
        the `subject` request parameter is mandatory. If the token delivery mode is `push`, the API will generate
        an access token, an ID token and optionally a refresh token. On the other hand, if the token delivery
        mode is `poll` or `ping`, the API will just update the database record so that `/auth/token` API
        can generate tokens later.

        When the authorization server received the decision of the end-user from the authentication device
        and it indicates that the end-user has rejected to give authorization to the client, the authorization
        server should call the API with `result=ACCESS_DENIED`. In this case, if the token delivery mode
        is `push`, the API will generate an error response that contains the error response parameter and
        optionally the `error_description` and error_uri response parameters (if the `errorDescription`
        and `errorUri` request parameters have been given). On the other hand, if the token delivery mode
        is `poll` or `ping`, the API will just update the database record so that `/auth/token` API can
        generate an error response later. In any token delivery mode, the value of the error parameter will
        become `access_denied`.

        When the authorization server could not get the result of end-user authentication and authorization
        from the authentication device for some reasons, the authorization server should call the API with
        `result=TRANSACTION_FAILED`. In this error case, the API will behave in the same way as in the case
        of `ACCESS_DENIED`. The only difference is that `expired_token` is used as the value of the `error`
        parameter.

        The response from `/backchannel/authentication/complete` API has various parameters. Among them,
        it is `action` parameter that the authorization server implementation should check first because
        it denotes the next action that the authorization server implementation should take. According to
        the value of `action`, the service implementation must take the steps described below.

        **SERVER_ERROR**

        When the value of `action` is `SERVER_ERROR`, it means either (1) that the request from the authorization
        server to Authlete was wrong, or (2) that an error occurred on Authlete side.

        When the backchannel token delivery mode is `ping` or `push`, `SERVER_ERROR` is used only when
        an error is detected before the record of the ticket (which is included in the API call to `/backchannel/authentication/complete`)
        is retrieved from the database successfully. If an error is detected after the record of the ticket
        is retrieved from the database, `NOTIFICATION` is used instead of `SERVER_ERROR`.

        When the backchannel token delivery mode is `poll`, `SERVER_ERROR` is used regardless of whether
        it is before or after the record of the ticket is retrieved from the database.

        **NO_ACTION**

        When the value of `action` is `NO_ACTION`, it means that the authorization server does not have
        to take any immediate action.

        `NO_ACTION` is returned when the backchannel token delivery mode is `poll`. In this case, the client
        will receive the final result at the token endpoint.

        **NOTIFICATION**

        When the value of `action` is `NOTIFICATION`, it means that the authorization server must send a
        notification to the client notification endpoint.

        According to the CIBA Core specification, the notification is an HTTP POST request whose request
        body is JSON and whose `Authorization` header contains the client notification token, which was
        included in the backchannel authentication request as the value of the `client_notification_token`
        request parameter, as a bearer token.

        When the backchannel token delivery mode is `ping`, the request body of the notification is JSON
        which contains the `auth_req_id` property only. When the backchannel token delivery mode is `push`,
        the request body will additionally contain an access token, an ID token and other properties. Note
        that when the backchannel token delivery mode is `poll`, a notification does not have to be sent
        to the client notification endpoint.

        In error cases, in the ping mode, however, the content of a notification is not different from the
        content in successful cases. That is, the notification contains the `auth_req_id` property only.
        The client will know the error when it accesses the token endpoint. On the other hand, in the
        `push` mode, in error cases, the content of a notification will include the `error` property instead
        of an access token and an ID token. The client will know the error by detecting that error is included
        in the notification.

        In any case, the value of `responseContent` is JSON which can be used as the request body of the
        notification.

        The client notification endpoint that the notification should be sent to the value of the `clientNotificationEndpoint`
        parameter. Likewise, the client notification token that the notification should include as a bearer
        token is the `clientNotificationToken` parameter. With these methods, the notification can be built
        like the following.

        ```
        POST {clientNotificationEndpoint} HTTP/1.1
        HOST: {The host of clientNotificationEndpoint}
        Authorization: Bearer {notificationToken}
        Content-Type: application/json

        {responseContent}
        ```

        This API parses request parameters of a [device authorization request](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8628#section-3.1)
        and returns necessary data for the authorization server implementation to process the device authorization
        request further.

        <br>
        <details>
        <summary>Description</summary>

        This API is supposed to be called from the within the implementation of the device authorization
        endpoint of the service. The service implementation should retrieve the value of `action` from the
        response and take the following steps according to the value.

        **INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR**

        When the value of `action` is `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`, it means that the API call from the authorization
        server implementation was wrong or that an error occurred in Authlete.

        In either case, from a viewpoint of the client application, it is an error on the server side.
        Therefore, the authorization server implementation should generate a response to the client application
        with "500 Internal Server Error"s and `application/json`.

        The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes t he error, so it can be
        used as the entity body of the response.

        The following illustrates the response which the authorization server implementation should generate
        and return to the client application.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
        Content-Type: application/json
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache

        {responseContent}
        ```

        **BAD_REQUEST**

        When the value of `action` is `BAD_REQUEST`, it means that the request from the client application
        is wrong.

        The authorization server implementation should generate a response to the client application with
        "400 Bad Request" and `application/json`.

        The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used as
        the entity body of the response.

        The following illustrates the response which the service implementation should generate and return
        to the client application.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
        Content-Type: application/json
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache

        {responseContent}
        ```

        **UNAUTHORIZED**

        When the value of `action` is `UNAUTHORIZED`, it means that client authentication of the device authorization
        request failed.

        The authorization server implementation should generate a response to the client application with
        "401 Unauthorized" and `application/json`.

        The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used as
        the entity body of the response.

        The following illustrates the response which the service implementation must generate and return
        to the client application.

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
        WWW-Authenticate: (challenge)
        Content-Type: application/json
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache

        {responseContent}
        ```

        **OK**

        When the value of `action` is `OK`, it means that the device authorization request from the client
        application is valid.

        The authorization server implementation should generate a response to the client application with
        "200 OK" and `application/json`.

        The `responseContent` is a JSON string which can be used as the entity body of the response.

        The following illustrates the response which the authorization server implementation should generate
        and return to the client application.

        The API returns information associated with a user code.

        <br>
        <details>
        <summary>Description</summary>

        After receiving a response from the device authorization endpoint of the authorization server,
        the client application shows the end-user the user code and the verification URI which are included
        in the device authorization response. Then, the end-user will access the verification URI using
        a web browser on another device (typically, a smart phone). In normal implementations, the verification
        endpoint will return an HTML page with an input form where the end-user inputs a user code. The
        authorization server will receive a user code from the form.

        After receiving a user code, the authorization server should call Authlete's `/device/verification`
        API with the user code. And then, the authorization server implementation should retrieve the value
        of `action` parameter from the API response and take the following steps according to the value.

        **SERVER_ERROR**

        When the value of `action` is `SERVER_ERROR`, it means that an error occurred on Authlete side. The
        authorization server implementation should tell the end-user that something wrong happened and
        urge her to re-initiate a device flow.

        **NOT_EXIST**

        When the value of `action` is `NOT_EXIST`, it means that the user code does not exist. The authorization
        server implementation should tell the end-user that the user code is invalid and urge her to retry
        to input a valid user code.

        **EXPIRED**

        When the value of `action` is `EXPIRED`, it means that the user code has expired. The authorization
        server implementation should tell the end-user that the user code has expired and urge her to
        re-initiate a device flow.

        **VALID**

        When the value of `action` is `VALID`, it means that the user code exists, has not expired, and
        belongs to the service. The authorization server implementation should interact with the end-user
        to ask whether she approves or rejects the authorization request from the device.

        This API returns information about what action the authorization server should take after it receives
        the result of end-user's decision about whether the end-user has approved or rejected a client
        application's request.

        <br>
        <details>
        <summary>Description</summary>

        In the device flow, an end-user accesses the verification endpoint of the authorization server where
        she interacts with the verification endpoint and inputs a user code. The verification endpoint checks
        if the user code is valid and then asks the end-user whether she approves or rejects the authorization
        request which the user code represents.

        After the authorization server receives the decision of the end-user, it should call Authlete's
        `/device/complete` API to tell Authlete the decision.

        When the end-user was authenticated and authorization was granted to the client by the end-user,
        the authorization server should call the API with `result=AUTHORIZED`. In this successful case,
        the subject request parameter is mandatory. The API will update the database record so that `/auth/token`
        API can generate an access token later.

        If the `scope` parameter of the device authorization request included the openid scope, an ID token
        is generated. In this case, `sub`, `authTime`, `acr` and `claims` request parameters in the API
        call to `/device/complete` affect the ID token.

        When the authorization server receives the decision of the end-user and it indicates that she has
        rejected to give authorization to the client, the authorization server should call the API with
        `result=ACCESS_DENIED`. In this case, the API will update the database record so that the `/auth/token`
        API can generate an error response later. If `errorDescription` and `errorUri` request parameters
        are given to the `/device/complete` API, they will be used as the values of `error_description`
        and `error_uri` response parameters in the error response from the token endpoint.

        When the authorization server could not get decision from the end-user for some reasons, the authorization
        server should call the API with `result=TRANSACTION_FAILED`. In this error case, the API will behave
        in the same way as in the case of `ACCESS_DENIED`. The only difference is that `expired_token` is
        used as the value of the `error` response parameter instead of `access_denied`.

        After receiving a response from the `/device/complete` API, the implementation of the authorization
        server should retrieve the value of `action` from the response and take the following steps according
        to the value.

        **SERVER_ERROR**

        When the value of `action` is `SERVER_ERROR`, it means that an error occurred on Authlete side. The
        authorization server implementation should tell the end-user that something wrong happened and
        urge her to re-initiate a device flow.

        **USER_CODE_NOT_EXIST**

        When the value of `action` is `USER_CODE_NOT_EXIST`, it means that the user code included in the API
        call does not exist. The authorization server implementation should tell the end-user that the user
        code has been invalidated and urge her to re-initiate a device flow.

        **USER_CODE_EXPIRED**

        When the value of `action` is `USER_CODE_EXPIRED`,  it means that the user code included in the API
        call has expired. The authorization server implementation should tell the end-user that the user
        code has expired and urge her to re-initiate a device flow.

        **INVALID_REQUEST**

        When the value of `action` is `INVALID_REQUEST`, it means that the API call is invalid. Probably,
        the authorization server implementation has some bugs.

        **SUCCESS**

        When the value of `action` is `SUCCESS`, it means that the API call has been processed successfully.
        The authorization server should return a successful response to the web browser the end-user is
        using.

        This API gathers the federation configuration about a service.

        The authorization server implementation should
        retrieve the value of the <code>action</code>
        response parameter from the API response and take the following steps
        according to the value.

        <h3><code>OK</code></h3>

        When the value of the <code> action</code> response
        parameter is <code>OK</code>, it means that Authlete
        could prepare an entity configuration successfully.

        In this case, the implementation of the entity configuration endpoint of the
        authorization server should return an HTTP response to the client application
        with the HTTP status code "{@code 200 OK}" and the content type
        "{@code application/entity-statement+jwt}". The message body (= an entity
        configuration in the JWT format) of the response has been prepared by
        Authlete's {@code /federation/configuration} API and it is available as the
        <code>responseContent</code> response parameter.

        The implementation of the entity configuration endpoint can construct an
        HTTP response by doing like below.

        <pre style="border: solid 1px black; padding: 0.5em;">
        200 OK
        Content-Type: application/entity-statement+jwt
        (Other HTTP headers)

        <i>(the value of the responseContent response parameter)</i></pre>

        <h3><code>NOT_FOUND</code></h3>

        When the value of the <code> action</code> response
        parameter is <code>NOT_FOUND</code>, it means that
        the service configuration has not enabled the feature of <a href=
        "https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-federation-1_0.html">OpenID Connect
        Federation 1.0</a> and so the client application should have not access the
        entity configuration endpoint.

        In this case, the implementation of the entity configuration endpoint of the
        authorization server should return an HTTP response to the client application
        with the HTTP status code "{@code 404 Not Found}" and the content type
        "{@code application/json}". The message body (= error information in the JSON
        format) of the response has been prepared by Authlete's
        {@code /federation/configuration} API and it is available as the
        <code>responseContent</code> response parameter.

        The implementation of the entity configuration endpoint can construct an
        HTTP response by doing like below.

        <pre style="border: solid 1px black; padding: 0.5em;">
        404 Not Found
        Content-Type: application/json
        (Other HTTP headers)

        <i>(the value of the responseContent response parameter)</i></pre>

        <h3><code>INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR</code></h3>

        could prepare an entity configuration successfully.

        In this case, the implementation of the entity configuration endpoint of the
        authorization server should return an HTTP response to the client application
        with the HTTP status code "{@code 200 OK}" and the content type
        "{@code application/entity-statement+jwt}". The message body (= an entity
        configuration in the JWT format) of the response has been prepared by
        Authlete's {@code /federation/configuration} API and it is available as the
        <code>responseContent</code> response parameter.

        The implementation of the entity configuration endpoint can construct an
        HTTP response by doing like below.

        <pre style="border: solid 1px black; padding: 0.5em;">
        200 OK
        Content-Type: application/entity-statement+jwt
        (Other HTTP headers)

        <i>(the value of the responseContent response parameter)</i></pre>

            Redirect URIs that the client application uses to receive a response from the authorization endpoint.
            Requirements for a redirect URI are as follows.

            **Requirements by RFC 6749** (From [RFC 6749, 3.1.2. Redirection Endpoint](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-3.1.2))

            - Must be an absolute URI.
            - Must not have a fragment component.

            **Requirements by OpenID Connect** (From "[OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0, 2.
            Client Metadata](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html#ClientMetadata),
            application_type")

            - The scheme of the redirect URI used for Implicit Grant by a client application whose application
            is `web` must be `https`. This is checked at runtime by Authlete.
            - The hostname of the redirect URI used for Implicit Grant by a client application whose application
            type is `web` must not be `localhost`. This is checked at runtime by Authlete.
            - The scheme of the redirect URI used by a client application whose application type is `native`
            must be either (1) a custom scheme or (2) `http`, which is allowed only when the hostname part
            is `localhost`. This is checked at runtime by Authlete.

            **Requirements by Authlete**

            - Must consist of printable ASCII letters only.
            - Must not exceed 200 letters.

            Note that Authlete allows the application type to be `null`. In other words, a client application
            does not have to choose `web` or `native` as its application type.
            If the application type is `null`, the requirements by OpenID Connect are not checked at runtime.

            An authorization request from a client application which has not registered any redirect URI
            fails unless at least all the following conditions are satisfied.

            - The client type of the client application is `confidential`.
            - The value of `response_type` request parameter is `code`.
            - The authorization request has the `redirect_uri` request parameter.
            - The value of `scope` request parameter does not contain `openid`.

            RFC 6749 allows partial match of redirect URI under some conditions (see [RFC 6749, 3.1.2.2.
            Registration Requirements](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-3.1.2.2) for
            details), but OpenID Connect requires exact match.

            and [RFC 7592](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7592.html)) are, if supported by Authlete, set
            to corresponding properties of the client application. For example, the value of the `client_name`
            client metadata in Client Registration/Update Request is set to the clientName property. On the
            other hand, unrecognized client metadata are discarded.

            By listing up custom client metadata in advance by using the `supportedCustomClientMetadata` property
            of Service, Authlete can recognize them and stores their values into the database. The stored

            Endpoint, which is defined in [OAuth 2.0 Pushed Authorization Requests](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9126/).
            Unecrypted request objects are accepted at the endpoint even if this flag is `true`.

            This flag does not indicate whether a request object is always required. There is a different
            flag, `requestObjectRequired`, for the purpose.

            Even if this flag is `false`, encryption of request object is required if the `frontChannelRequestObjectEncryptionRequired`

              since this signals to the OP that a client_secret value needs to be returned from which the
              symmetric key will be derived, that might not otherwise be returned. The RP MAY still use other
              supported encryption algorithms or send unencrypted Request Objects, even when this parameter
              is present. If both signing and encryption are requested, the Request Object will be signed
              then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT, as defined in [JWT]. The default, if omitted,
              is that the RP is not declaring whether it might encrypt any Request Objects.

            The point here is "The RP MAY still use other supported encryption algorithms or send unencrypted
            Request Objects, even when this parameter is present."

            The property that represents the client metadata is `requestEncryptionAlg`. See the description

              MUST also be provided.

            The property that represents the client metadata is `requestEncryptionEnc`. See the description

Authentication Request, scope](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest). Without this scope, Authlete does not allow `response_type` request parameter to have values other than code and token. |

            When a request has no explicit `scope` parameter and the service's pre-defined default scope set is empty,
            the authorization server regards the request requests no scope. When this flag is set to `true`,
            requests that request no scope are rejected.

            The requirement below excerpted from [RFC 6749 Section 3.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.3)
            does not explicitly mention the case where the default scope set is empty.

            > If the client omits the scope parameter when requesting authorization, the authorization server
            MUST either process the request using a pre-defined default value or fail the request indicating an invalid scope.

            However, if you interpret *"the default scope set exists but is empty"* as *"the default scope set does not exist"*

            The FAPI-CIBA profile requires that the authorization server _"shall ensure unique authorization
            context exists in the authorization request or require a `binding_message` in the authorization
            request"_ (FAPI-CIBA, 5.2.2, 2). The simplest way to fulfill this requirement is to set this property
            to `true`.

            If this property is set to `false`, the `binding_message` request parameter remains optional
            even in FAPI context, but in exchange, your authorization server must implement a custom mechanism
            that ensures each backchannel authentication request has unique context.

            The fixed string is replaced with an actual user code when Authlete builds a verification URI

        nbfOptional:

            The flag indicating whether the nbf claim in the request object is optional even when the authorization
            request is regarded as a FAPI-Part2 request.

            The final version of Financial-grade API was approved in January, 2021. The Part 2 of the final
            version has new requirements on lifetime of request objects. They require that request objects
            contain an `nbf` claim and the lifetime computed by `exp` - `nbf` be no longer than 60 minutes.

            Therefore, when an authorization request is regarded as a FAPI-Part2 request, the request object
            used in the authorization request must contain an nbf claim. Otherwise, the authorization server
            rejects the authorization request.

            When this flag is `true`, the `nbf` claim is treated as an optional claim even when the authorization
            request is regarded as a FAPI-Part2 request. That is, the authorization server does not perform
            the validation on lifetime of the request object.

            Skipping the validation is a violation of the FAPI specification. The reason why this flag has
            been prepared nevertheless is that the new requirements (which do not exist in the Implementer's
            Draft 2 released in October, 2018) have big impacts on deployed implementations of client
            applications and Authlete thinks there should be a mechanism whereby to make the migration
            from ID2 to Final smooth without breaking live systems.

        issSuppressed:

            The flag indicating whether generation of the iss response parameter is suppressed.

            "OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Issuer Identifier in Authorization Response" has defined a new
            authorization response parameter, `iss`, as a countermeasure for a certain type of mix-up attacks.

            The specification requires that the `iss` response parameter always be included in authorization
            responses unless JARM (JWT Secured Authorization Response Mode) is used.

            When this flag is `true`, the authorization server does not include the `iss` response parameter
            in authorization responses. By turning this flag on and off, developers of client applications
            can experiment the mix-up attack and the effect of the `iss` response parameter.

            Note that this flag should not be `true` in production environment unless there are special
            reasons for it.

            Standard client metadata included in Client Registration Request and Client Update Request (cf.

            and [RFC 7592](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7592.html)) are, if supported by Authlete, stored
            into Authlete database. On the other hand, unrecognized client metadata are discarded.

            By listing up custom client metadata in advance by using this property (`supportedCustomClientMetadata`),
            Authlete can recognize them and stores their values into the database. The stored custom client
            metadata values can be referenced by `customMetadata`.

          description: |
            The flag indicating whether the expiration date of an access token never exceeds that of the
            corresponding refresh token.

            When a new access token is issued by a refresh token request (= a token request with `grant_type=refresh_token`),
            the expiration date of the access token may exceed the expiration date of the corresponding
            refresh token. This behavior itself is not wrong and may happen when `refreshTokenKept` is
            `true` and/or when `refreshTokenDurationKept` is `true`.

            When this flag is `true`, the expiration date of an access token never exceeds that of the corresponding
            refresh token regardless of the calculated duration based on other settings such as `accessTokenDuration`,
            `accessTokenDuration` in `extension` and `access_token.duration` scope attribute.

            It is technically possible to set a value which is bigger than the duration of refresh tokens
            as the duration of access tokens although it is strange. In the case, the duration of an access
            token becomes longer than the duration of the refresh token which is issued together with the
            access token. Even if the duration values are configured so, if this flag is `true`, the expiration
            date of the access token does not exceed that of the refresh token. That is, the duration of
            the access token will be shortened, and as a result, the access token and the refresh token
            will have the same expiration date.

            Unecrypted request objects are accepted at the endpoint even if this flag is `true`.

            This flag does not indicate whether a request object is always required. There is a different

            for details.

            Request Objects sent to the OP. This parameter SHOULD be included when symmetric encryption
            will be used, since this signals to the OP that a client_secret value needs to be returned
            from which the symmetric key will be derived, that might not otherwise be returned. The RP
            MAY still use other supported encryption algorithms or send unencrypted Request Objects, even
            when this parameter is present. If both signing and encryption are requested, the Request Object
            will be signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT, as defined in [JWT]. The
            default, if omitted, is that the RP is not declaring whether it might encrypt any Request Objects.

            The point here is "The RP MAY still use other supported encryption algorithms or send unencrypted

            strictly.

            For backward compatibility (to avoid breaking running systems), Authlete's `/api/client/registration`
            API does not return the `UNAUTHORIZED` enum value if this flag is not turned on.

            The steps an existing implementation of client configuration endpoint has to do in order to
            conform to the requirement related to "401 Unauthorized" are as follows.

            1. Update the Authlete library (e.g. authlete-java-common) your system is using.
            2. Update your implementation of client configuration endpoint so that it can handle the
            `UNAUTHORIZED` action.
            3. Turn on this `unauthorizedOnClientConfigSupported` flag.

            Limiting the range of scopes that a client can request is achieved by listing scopes in the
            `client.extension.requestableScopes` property and setting the `client.extension.requestableScopesEnabled`
            property to `true`. This feature is called "requestable scopes".

          description: |
            The flag indicating whether the port number component of redirection URIs can be variable when
            the host component indicates loopback.

            When this flag is `true`, if the host component of a redirection URI specified in an authorization
            request indicates loopback (to be precise, when the host component is localhost, `127.0.0.1`
            or `::1`), the port number component is ignored when the specified redirection URI is compared
            to pre-registered ones. This behavior is described in [7.3. Loopback Interface Redirection](
            https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8252.html#section-7.3) of [RFC 8252 OAuth 2.0](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8252.html)
            for Native Apps.

            [3.1.2.3. Dynamic Configuration](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html#section-3.1.2.3)
            of [RFC 6749](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749.html) states _"If the client registration
            included the full redirection URI, the authorization server MUST compare the two URIs using
            simple string comparison as defined in [RFC3986] Section 6.2.1."_ Also, the description of
            `redirect_uri` in [3.1.2.1. Authentication Request](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest)
            of [OpenID Connect Core 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) states
            _"This URI MUST exactly match one of the Redirection URI values for the Client pre-registered
            at the OpenID Provider, with the matching performed as described in Section 6.2.1 of [RFC3986]
            (**Simple String Comparison**)."_ These "Simple String Comparison" requirements are preceded
            by this flag. That is, even when the conditions described in RFC 6749 and OpenID Connect Core 1.0
            are satisfied, the port number component of loopback redirection URIs can be variable when this
            flag is `true`.

            [8.3. Loopback Redirect Considerations](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8252.html#section-8.3)
            of [RFC 8252](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8252.html) states as follows.

            > While redirect URIs using localhost (i.e., `"http://localhost:{port}/{path}"`) function
            similarly to loopback IP redirects described in Section 7.3, the use of localhost is NOT RECOMMENDED.
            Specifying a redirect URI with the loopback IP literal rather than localhost avoids inadvertently
            listening on network interfaces other than the loopback interface. It is also less susceptible
            to client-side firewalls and misconfigured host name resolution on the user's device.

            However, Authlete allows the port number component to be variable in the case of `localhost`,
            too. It is left to client applications whether they use `localhost` or a literal loopback IP
            address (`127.0.0.1` for IPv4 or `::1` for IPv6).

            Section 7.3 and Section 8.3 of [RFC 8252](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8252.html) state
            that loopback redirection URIs use the `"http"` scheme, but Authlete allows the port number
            component to be variable in other cases (e.g. in the case of the `"https"` scheme), too.

            The flag indicating whether Authlete checks whether the `aud` claim of request objects matches

            [Section 6.1. Passing a Request Object by Value](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#JWTRequests)
            of [OpenID Connect Core 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) has the following
            statement.

            > The `aud` value SHOULD be or include the OP's Issuer Identifier URL.

            Likewise, [Section 4. Request Object](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9101.html#section-4) of
            [RFC 9101](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9101.html) (The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework:
            JWT-Secured Authorization Request (JAR)) has the following statement.

            > The value of aud should be the value of the authorization server (AS) issuer, as defined in
            [RFC 8414](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8414.html).

            As excerpted above, validation on the `aud` claim of request objects is optional. However, if
            this flag is turned on, Authlete checks whether the `aud` claim of request objects matches the issuer
            identifier of this service and raises an error if they are different.

          description: |
            The scopes that the client application requests. This value comes from `scope` request parameter.
            If the request does not contain `scope` parameter, this parameter is a list of scopes which are registered as default.
            If the authorization request does not have `scope` request parameter and the service has not registered any default scope,
            the value of this parameter is `null`.

            It is ensured that scopes listed by this parameters are contained in the list of supported scopes which are specified
            by `supportedScopes` configuration parameter of the service. Unsupported scopes in the authorization request do not cause
            an error and are just ignored.

            OpenID Connect defines some scope names which need to be treated specially. The table below lists the special scope names.

            | Name | Description |
            | --- | --- |
            | `openid` | This scope must be contained in `scope` request parameter to promote an OAuth 2.0 authorization request to an OpenID Connect request. It is described in "[OpenID Connect Core 1.0, 3.1.2.1. Authentication Request](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest), scope". |
            | `profile` | This scope is used to request some claims to be embedded in the ID token. The claims are `name`, `family_name`, `given_name`, `middle_name`, `nickname`, `preferred_username`, `profile`, `picture`, `website`, `gender`, `birthdate`, `zoneinfo`, `locale`, and `updated_at`. It is described in [OpenID Connect Core 1.0, 5.4. Requesting Claims using Scope Values](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ScopeClaims). |
            | `email` | This scope is used to request some claims to be embedded in the ID token. The claims are `email` and `email_verified`. It is described in [OpenID Connect Core 1.0, 5.4. Requesting Claims using Scope Values](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ScopeClaims). |
            | `address` |  This scope is used to request `address` claim to be embedded in the ID token. It is described in [OpenID Connect Core 1.0, 5.4. Requesting Claims using Scope Values](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ScopeClaims).<br><br> The format of `address` claim is not a simple string. It is described in [OpenID Connect Core 1.0, 5.1.1. Address Claim](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AddressClaim).  |
            | `phone` | This scope is used to request some claims to be embedded in the ID token. The claims are `phone_number` and `phone_number_verified`. It is described in [OpenID Connect Core 1.0, 5.4. Requesting Claims using Scope Values](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ScopeClaims).  |
            | `offline_access` | The following is an excerpt about this scope from [OpenID Connect Core 1.0, 11. Offline Access](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#OfflineAccess). <blockquote>This scope value requests that an OAuth 2.0 Refresh Token be issued that can be used to obtain an Access Token that grants access to the end-user's userinfo endpoint even when the end-user is not present (not logged in).</blockquote>  |

            Note that, if `response_type` request parameter does not contain code, `offline_acccess` scope is removed from this list even
            when scope request parameter contains `offline_access`. This behavior is a requirement written in
            [OpenID Connect Core 1.0, 11. Offline Access](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#OfflineAccess).

        uiLocales:
          description: |
            The locales that the client application presented as candidates to be used for UI.
            This value comes from `ui_locales` request parameter. The format of `ui_locales` is a space-separated list of language tag values
            defined in [RFC5646](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5646).

            A client application may request certain claims be embedded in an ID token or in a response from the userInfo endpoint.
            There are several ways. Including the `claims` request parameter and including the `claims` property in a request object are such examples.
            In both the cases, the value of the `claims` parameter/property is JSON. Its format is described in [5.5. Requesting Claims using the "claims"
            Request Parameter](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClaimsParameter).

            The following is an excerpt from the specification.
            You can find `userinfo` and `id_token` are top-level properties.

            ```json
            {
              "userinfo":
              {
                "given_name": { "essential": true },
                "nickname": null,
                "email": { "essential": true },

                "acr": { "values": [ "urn:mace:incommon:iap:silver" ] }
              }
            }
            ```

            This value of this property is the value of the `id_token` property in JSON format.
            For example, if the JSON above is included in an authorization request, this property holds JSON equivalent to the following.

            ```json
            {

            }
            ```

            The subject identifying the user who has given the grant identified

            Authlete 2.3 and newer versions support <a href=
            "https://openid.net/specs/fapi-grant-management.html">Grant Management
            for OAuth 2.0</a>. An authorization request may contain a {@code grant_id}
            request parameter which is defined in the specification. If the value of
            the request parameter is valid, {@link #getGrantSubject()} will return
            the subject of the user who has given the grant to the client application.
            Authorization server implementations may use the value returned from
            {@link #getGrantSubject()} in order to determine the user to authenticate.

            The user your system will authenticate during the authorization process
            (or has already authenticated) may be different from the user of the
            grant. The first implementer's draft of "Grant Management for OAuth 2.0"
            does not mention anything about the case, so the behavior in the case is
            left to implementations. Authlete will not perform the grant management
            action when the {@code subject} passed to Authlete does not match the
            user of the grant.

          description: |
            Get names of claims that are requested indirectly by <i>"transformed
            claims"</i>.

            <p>
            A client application can request <i>"transformed claims"</i> by adding
            names of transformed claims in the `claims` request parameter.
            The following is an example of the `claims` request parameter
            that requests a predefined transformed claim named `18_or_over`
            and a transformed claim named `nationality_usa` to be embedded
            in the response from the userinfo endpoint.
            </p>

            ```json
            {
              "transformed_claims": {
                "nationality_usa": {
                  "claim": "nationalities",
                  "fn": [
                    [ "eq", "USA" ],
                    "any"
                  ]
                }
              },
              "userinfo": {
                "::18_or_over": null,
                ":nationality_usa": null
              }
            }
            ```

            The example above assumes that a transformed claim named `18_or_over`
            is predefined by the authorization server like below.

            ```json
            {
              "18_or_over": {
                "claim": "birthdate",
                "fn": [
                  "years_ago",
                  [ "gte", 18 ]
                ]
              }
            }
            ```

            In the example, the {@code nationalities} claim is requested indirectly
            by the `nationality_usa` transformed claim. Likewise, the
            {@code birthdate} claim is requested indirectly by the `18_or_over`
            transformed claim.

            When the `claims` request parameter of an authorization request is
            like the example above, this `requestedClaimsForTx` property will
            hold the following value.

            ```json
            [ "birthdate", "nationalities" ]
            ```

            It is expected that the authorization server implementation prepares values
            of the listed claims and passes them as the value of the `claimsForTx`
            request parameter when it calls the `/api/auth/userinfo/issue` API. The following
            is an example of the value of the `claimsForTx` request parameter.

            ```json
            {
              "birthdate": "1970-01-23",
              "nationalities": [ "DEU", "USA" ]

            The target resources this proeprty holds may be the same as or different from the ones `resource` property holds.

            In some flows, the initial request and the subsequent token request are sent to different endpoints.
            Example flows are the Authorization Code Flow, the Refresh Token Flow, the CIBA Ping Mode, the CIBA Poll Mode and the Device Flow.
            In these flows, not only the initial request but also the subsequent token request can include the `resource` request parameters.
            The purpose of the `resource` request parameters in the token request is to narrow the range of the target resources from the original
            set of target resources requested by the preceding initial request. If narrowing down is performed, the target resources holded by the
            `resource` proeprty and the ones holded by this property are different. This property holds the narrowed set of target resources.

            The value of the `userinfo` property in the `claims` request parameter or in the `claims` property in an authorization request object.

            A client application may request certain claims be embedded in an ID token or in a response from the userInfo endpoint.
            There are several ways. Including the `claims` request parameter and including the `claims` property in a request object are such examples.
            In both cases, the value of the `claims` parameter/property is JSON. Its format is described in [5.5. Requesting Claims using the "claims"
            Request Parameter](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClaimsParameter).

            The following is an excerpt from the specification. You can find `userinfo` and `id_token` are top-level properties.

            ```json
            {
              "userinfo":
              {
                "given_name": { "essential": true },
                "nickname": null,
                "email": { "essential": true },
                "email_verified": { "essential": true },
                "picture": null,
                "http://example.info/claims/groups": null
              },
              "id_token":
              {
                "auth_time": { "essential": true },
                "acr": { "values": [ "urn:mace:incommon:iap:silver" ] }
              }
            }
            ````

            The value of this property is the value of the `userinfo` property in JSON format.
            For example, if the JSON above is included in an authorization request, this property holds JSON equivalent to the following.

            ```json
            {
              "given_name": { "essential": true },
              "nickname": null,
              "email": { "essential": true },
              "email_verified": { "essential": true },
              "picture": null,
              "http://example.info/claims/groups": null
            }
            ```

            Note that if a request object is given and it contains the `claims` property and if the `claims` request parameter is also given,
            the value of this property holds the former value.

            Get names of claims that are requested indirectly by <i>"transformed
            claims"</i>.

            <p>
            A client application can request <i>"transformed claims"</i> by adding
            names of transformed claims in the `claims` request parameter.
            The following is an example of the `claims` request parameter
            that requests a predefined transformed claim named `18_or_over`
            and a transformed claim named `nationality_usa` to be embedded
            in the response from the userinfo endpoint.
            </p>

            ```json
            {
              "transformed_claims": {
                "nationality_usa": {
                  "claim": "nationalities",
                  "fn": [
                    [ "eq", "USA" ],
                    "any"
                  ]
                }
              },
              "userinfo": {
                "::18_or_over": null,
                ":nationality_usa": null
              }
            }
            ```

            The example above assumes that a transformed claim named `18_or_over`
            is predefined by the authorization server like below.

            ```json
            {
              "18_or_over": {
                "claim": "birthdate",
                "fn": [
                  "years_ago",
                  [ "gte", 18 ]
                ]
              }
            }
            ```

            In the example, the {@code nationalities} claim is requested indirectly
            by the `nationality_usa` transformed claim. Likewise, the
            {@code birthdate} claim is requested indirectly by the `18_or_over`
            transformed claim.

            When the `claims` request parameter of an authorization request is
            like the example above, this `requestedClaimsForTx` property will
            hold the following value.

            ```json
            [ "birthdate", "nationalities" ]
            ```

            It is expected that the authorization server implementation prepares values
            of the listed claims and passes them as the value of the `claimsForTx`
            request parameter when it calls the `/api/auth/userinfo/issue` API. The following
            is an example of the value of the `claimsForTx` request parameter.

            ```json
            {
              "birthdate": "1970-01-23",
              "nationalities": [ "DEU", "USA" ]
            }

            The subject identifying the user who has given the grant identified

            request.

            Authlete 2.3 and newer versions support <a href=
            "https://openid.net/specs/fapi-grant-management.html">Grant Management
            for OAuth 2.0</a>. An authorization request may contain a {@code grant_id}
            request parameter which is defined in the specification. If the value of
            the request parameter is valid, {@link #getGrantSubject()} will return
            the subject of the user who has given the grant to the client application.
            Authorization server implementations may use the value returned from
            {@link #getGrantSubject()} in order to determine the user to authenticate.

            The user your system will authenticate during the authorization process
            (or has already authenticated) may be different from the user of the
            grant. The first implementer's draft of "Grant Management for OAuth 2.0"
            does not mention anything about the case, so the behavior in the case is
            left to implementations. Authlete will not perform the grant management
            action when the {@code subject} passed to Authlete does not match the
            user of the grant.

            A boolean request parameter which indicates whether to emulate that the client ID alias is used
            instead of the original numeric client ID when a new access token is created.

            This has an effect only on the value of the aud claim in a response from [UserInfo endpoint](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo).
            When you access the UserInfo endpoint (which is expected to be implemented using Authlete's
            `/api/auth/userinfo` API and `/api/auth/userinfo/issue` API) with an access token which has been
            created using Authlete's `/api/auth/token/create` API with this property (`clientIdAliasUsed`)
            `true`, the client ID alias is used as the value of the aud claim in a response from the UserInfo
            endpoint.

            Note that if a client ID alias is not assigned to the client when Authlete's `/api/auth/token/create`
            API is called, this property (`clientIdAliasUsed`) has no effect (it is always regarded as `false`).

            The value of the new access token.

            The `/api/auth/token/create` API generates an access token. Therefore, callers of the API do not
            have to specify values of newly created access tokens. However, in some cases, for example, if
            you want to migrate existing access tokens from an old system to Authlete, you may want to specify
            values of access tokens. In such a case, you can specify the value of a newly created access token
            by passing a non-null value as the value of accessToken request parameter. The implementation
            of the `/api/auth/token/create` uses the value of the accessToken request parameter instead of
            generating a new value when the request parameter holds a non-null value.

            Note that if the hash value of the specified access token already exists in Authlete's database,
            the access token cannot be inserted and the `/api/auth/token/create` API will report an error.

            not have to specify values of newly created refresh tokens. However, in some cases, for example,
            if you want to migrate existing refresh tokens from an old system to Authlete, you may want to
            specify values of refresh tokens. In such a case, you can specify the value of a newly created
            refresh token by passing a non-null value as the value of refreshToken request parameter. The
            implementation of the `/api/auth/token/create` uses the value of the refreshToken request parameter
            instead of generating a new value when the request parameter holds a non-null value.

            Note that if the hash value of the specified refresh token already exists in Authlete's database,
            the refresh token cannot be inserted and the `/api/auth/token/create` API will report an error.
